## Supply and Demand

> [!definition] Demand
> The **quantity demanded** $Q^d$ of a good is the amount of good that **consumers are willing and able to purchase**.

> [!law] Law of Demand
> The **quantity demanded** of a good **increases** as the **price falls**.
> So, **price and quantity demanded are inversely related**.

## Supply

> [!definition] Supply
> The **quantity supplied** of any good is the **amount that sellers are willing and able to sell**

> [!law] Law of Supply
> The **quantity supplied** $Q^s$ of a good **increases** as the **price rises** (holding all else constant).
> So, **price and quantity supplied are directly related**.

---

## Market supply/demand Curve

-   illustrates the relationship between the total quantity demanded/supplied and the price of a good
-   holding **all other variables constant**
-   $Q$ on the **horizontal** axis
-   $P$ on the **vertical** axis

---

## Willingness to Pay

> [!definition] Willingness to Pay (WTP)
> A consumer's **Willingness to Pay (WTP)** for a good is the **maximum amount the buyer will pay** for that good.
> It reflects how much the buyer values the good.

## Willingness to Sell

> [!definition] Willingness to Sell (WTS)
> A producer's **Willingness to Sell (WTS)** for a good is the **minimum amount the seller will accept** for that good.
> It reflects how much the seller values the good.

---

## Changes in Demand and Supply

> [!law] Changes in Demand/Supply
>
> Changing **<u>only price</u>**:
>
> -   Leads to changes in **<u>quantity</u> demanded $Q^d$ / <u>quantity</u> supplied $Q^s$**
> -   Movement _along_ the demand/supply curve
>
> Changing **<u>other variables</u>**:
>
> -   Leads to changes in **<u>demand/supply</u>**
> -   **Shifts** the _entire_ demand/supply curve

## Demand Shifters

### Income

> [!definition] Normal good
> A **normal good** is a good for which an **increase in income causes an increase in demand**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand} \uparrow \text{ when Income} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. fruits, clothing, electronics_

> [!definition] Inferior good
> An **inferior good** is a good for which an **increase in income causes a decrease in demand**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand} \downarrow \text{ when Income} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. instant noodles, bus rides, used cars_

### Related Goods

> [!definition] Substitutes
> Two goods are **substitutes** if an **increase in the price of one causes an increase in demand for the other**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand of Good A} \uparrow \text{ when Price of Good B} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. butter and margarine, tea and coffee, Coke and Pepsi_

> [!definition] Complements
> Two goods are **complements** if an **increase in the price of one causes a decrease in demand for the other**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand of Good A} \downarrow \text{ when Price of Good B} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. cars and gasoline, printers and ink cartridges, smartphone and apps_

### Other demand shifters

-   Advertising and consumer tastes
-   Population (e.g. age distribution, demographics)
-   Expectations about future prices and income

## Supply Shifters

-   Input prices
    -   Wage $r$
    -   Price of raw materials
-   Technology
-   Government regulation
-   Number of firms (entry and exit)
-   Taxes

## Consumer Surplus

> [!definition] Consumer Surplus (CS)
> The **consumer surplus** is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the amount the consumer actually pays for it.
> It measures the benefit to consumers from participating in the market.
> $$\boxed{CS = \text{(value to buyers)} - \text{(amount paid by buyers)}} = \text{buyers's gains from particip.}$$
> It equals the **area below the demand curve and above the price**, from $0$ to $Q^d$.

> [!formula] Consumer Surplus (CS)
> $$ \boxed{CS = WTP - P}$$

> [!definition] Total Consumer Value
> Sum of the WTP's at different quantities.
>
> $$
> \text{Total Consumer Value} = \int_{0}^{Q^d} WTP(Q) \, dQ
> $$

> [!definition] Total Expenditure
> Per-unit market price times number of units purchased.
> $$ \text{Total Expenditure} = P \times Q^d $$

> [!formula] Consumer Surplus as Total Consumer Value minus Total Expenditure
>
> $$
> \boxed{CS = \text{Total Consumer Value} - \text{Total Expenditure}}
> $$

Two reasons for fall in CS when price rises:

1. Some consumers leave the market (lower $Q^d$)
2. Remaining consumers pay a higher price (higher $P$)

## Producer Surplus

> [!definition] Producer Surplus (PS)
> The **producer surplus** is the amount producers receive in excess of the amount necessary to induce them to produce the good.
> $$\boxed{PS = \text{(amount received by sellers)} - \text{(cost to sellers)}} = \text{sellers's gains from particip.}$$
> It equals the **area above the supply curve and below the price**, from $0$ to $Q^s$.

Two reasons for fall in PS when price falls:

1. Some sellers leave the market (lower $Q^s$)
2. Remaining sellers receive a lower price (lower $P$)

## Total surplus

> [!definition] Total Surplus (TS)
> The **total surplus** is the total gains from trade in a market.
> $$\boxed{TS = CS + PS = \text{(value to buyers)} - \text{(cost to sellers)}}$$

-   We use total surplus as a measure of **society's well-being** or **social welfare**.
-   We consider whether the market's allocation is **efficient** = **maximizes total surplus**.

> [!rule]
> The market's allocation is **efficient** if it **maximizes total surplus**.

## Demand Function

### Linear Demand Function

A linear demand function has the form:

$$
\boxed{Q_X^d = \alpha_0 + \alpha_X P_X + \alpha_Y P_Y + \alpha_M M + \alpha_H H}
$$

Where

-   $Q_X^d$ = quantity demanded of good $X$
-   $P_X$ = price of good $X$
-   $Y$ = **related good**
-   $P_Y$ = price of related good $Y$
-   $M$ = **income**
-   $H$ = value of **any other variable affecting demand** (demand shifter)

### Inverse Demand Function

If we express$$
\boxed{P_X \text{ as a function of } Q_X^d}$$we obtain the **inverse demand function**.

## Supply Function

### Linear Supply Function

A linear supply function has the form:

$$
\boxed{Q_X^s = \beta_0 + \beta_X P_X + \beta_W W + \beta_r P_r + \beta_H H}
$$

-   $Q_X^s$ = number of units of good $X$ produced
-   $P_X$ = price of good $X$
-   $W$ = **price of an input**
-   $P_r$ = price of a **technologically related goods**
-   $H$ = value of **any other variable affecting supply** (supply shifter)

### Inverse Supply Function

If we express$$
\boxed{P_X \text{ as a function of } Q_X^s}$$we obtain the **inverse supply function**.

## Taxes

> [!definition] Excise Tax
> An **excise tax** is a tax that is a **fixed amount per unit sold**.
> _E.g. tax on cigarettes_

> [!definition] Ad Valorem Tax
> An **ad valorem tax** is a tax that is a **percentage of the price of the good**.
> _E.g. VAT (value-added tax)_

---

## Market Equilibrium

> [!definition] Market Equilibrium
> A market is in **equilibrium** when the **quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied**.
> $$ \boxed{Q^e = Q^d = Q^s} $$
> A price and quantity such that there is **no shortage** and **no surplus** (excess supply) in the market.
> The equilibrium price $P^e$ is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

Forces that drive market demand and supply are balanced: there is no pressure on prices or quantities to change.

> [!rule] Market Equilibrium Maximizes Total Surplus
> **The market equilibrium maximizes total surplus**, and therefore the **allocation of resources is efficient**.

---

## Price ceilings and Price floors

> [!definition] Price Ceiling
> A **price ceiling** is a legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold.
> _E.g. rent control_

> [!definition] Price Floor
> A **price floor** is a legal minimum on the price at which a good can be sold.
> _E.g. minimum wage_

### Changes in demand

_E.g. flowers and chocolates on Valentine's Day_

Increase in demand only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ increases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ increases

Decrease in demand only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ decreases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ decreases

### Changes in supply

_E.g. egg crisis in the US_

Increase in supply only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ decreases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ increases

Decrease in supply only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ increases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ decreases

## Competitive Market

> [!definition] Competitive Market
> A **competitive market** is a market with many buyers and sellers, each of whom has a negligible impact on the market price.
