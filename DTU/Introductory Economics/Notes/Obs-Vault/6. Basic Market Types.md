## Four Types of Markets

1. **PERFECT COMPETITION**
    - _Many_ buyers and sellers that are small relative to the market
    - Homogeneous products (i.e., _identical_)
    - Free entry and exit
    - Single market price is determined by market supply and demand
    - No transaction costs
    - Firms earn zero economic profit in the long run
2. **MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION**
    - _Many_ buyers and sellers
    - Differentiated products in each firm
    - Free entry and exit
3. **OLIGOPOLY**
    - _Few_ large firms
4. **MONOPOLY**
    - _One_ firm
    - Unique product
    - High barriers to entry
    - Price maker

## Perfect Competition

### Market supply and demand

Under perfect competition, the market supply and demand determine the equilibrium price $P^e$
$\quad \Longrightarrow$ the **demand curve of a single firm $D^f$** is **horizontal at $P^e$**.
$\quad \Longrightarrow$ the demand $D^f$ is **perfectly elastic** ($E_{Q,P} = \infty$).

> [!law] Competitive Firm's Demand Curve
> The demand curve of a single firm in a perfectly competitive market is **horizontal at the market price $P^e$**.
> This price is the competitive firm's **marginal revenue** $MR$.
> $$ \boxed{D^f: P = P^e = MR} $$

### Revenue of a Competitive Firm

-   **Total revenue** $TR = P \times Q$
-   **Average revenue** $AR = \frac{TR}{Q} = P$
-   **Marginal revenue** $MR = \frac{d TR}{d Q} = P$

> [!formula] Profits
>
> $$
> \boxed{\pi = TR - TC} = PQ - TC = (P - ATC)Q
> $$

To find the $Q$ that maximizes profit $\pi$, we **think at the margin**. If $MR>MC$, increase $Q$. If $MR<MC$, decrease $Q$.

> [!rule] Profit Maximization
> A firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity $Q^*$ such that
>
> $$
> \boxed{\pi(Q^*) \text{ maximized at } MR = MC}
> $$

So, to maximize profits, a perfectly competitive firm produces the output at which price equals marginal cost **in the range over which marginal cost is rising**.

> [!rule] Competitive Output Rule
>
> $$
> \boxed{P = MC(Q^*)}
> $$

So **MC** represents the firm's **supply curve**.

### Short-Run Operating Losses

Should a business shut down in the short run?

Remember that $$\pi = (P^e - ATC(Q^*))Q^*$$so if $P^e < ATC(Q^*)$, the firm incurs a loss.

-   If the firm shuts down, its **loss equals its fixed costs $FC$**: $$\pi_{shut\ down} = (P^e - (AFC + AVC(Q^*))Q^* = -FC$$
-   If the firm produces, its loss equals its **fixed cost + variable cost - TR**: $$\pi_{produce} = (P^e - (AFC + AVC(Q^*))Q^*$$

> [!rule] Short-Run Shutdown Rule
> A firm should **shut down in the short run** if the price is less than the average variable cost at the profit-maximizing quantity $Q^*$:
>
> $$
> \boxed{\text{Shut down} \iff P < AVC(Q^*)}
> $$

### Long-Run Decisions

In the long run, the market will experience **entry and exit of firms**.

-   Short-run profits: $\boxed{P^e > ATC(Q^*)}$
    -   $\rightarrow \text{new firms will enter the market}$
    -   $\rightarrow$ market supply increases (sum of all firms' supply curves)
    -   $\rightarrow$ market price $P^e$ falls
    -   $\rightarrow$ profits decrease
    -   $\rightarrow$ entry continues until **profits are zero**
-   Short-run losses: $\boxed{P^e < ATC(Q^*)}$
    -   $\rightarrow \text{some firms will exit the market}$
    -   $\rightarrow$ market supply decreases (sum of all firms' supply curves)
    -   $\rightarrow$ market price $P^e$ rises
    -   $\rightarrow$ losses decrease
    -   $\rightarrow$ exit continues until **profits are zero**

So, in the long run, a perfectly competitive firm earns **<u>zero economic profit</u>**: $$\boxed{P^e = ATC(Q^*)}$$

![[images/6-longrun-competitive.jpg]]

The long-run **competitive equilibrium** occurs when firms enter and exit the market until economic profits are zero.
Then, $Q^*$ is the output that **minimizes average total cost (ATC)**.

> [!rule] Long-Run Competitive Equilibrium
> In the long-run competitive equilibrium, the price **equals the minimum of average total cost**:

> $$
> \boxed{P=MC \quad \text{and} \quad P^e = \min ATC(Q)}
> $$
>

> $$
> \boxed{Q^* = \text{argmin } ATC(Q)}

## Monopolistic Competition

> [!definition] Monopoly
> A **monopoly** is a market structure in which a **single firm serves an entire market** for a good that has **no close substitutes**.

### Market Power

Sole seller of a good in a market gives that firm **great market power**, but n**ot unlimited** market power.

> [!rule] Monopolist's Demand Curve
> The **demand curve of a monopolist is the market demand curve**, which is **downward sloping**.
> $$D^f = D^M$$

So the **monopolist is constrained by the market demand curve**.

### Marginal Revenue of a Monopolist

![[images/6-monopoly-mr.jpg]]

> [!formula] Marginal Revenue of a Monopolist
>
> $$
> \boxed{MR = P \left(\frac{1 + E_{Q,P}}{E_{Q,P}}\right)}
> $$

Where $E_{Q,P}$ is the price elasticity of demand.

For $P>0$,

-   If demand is elastic ($E_{Q,P} < -1$), then $MR > 0$
-   If demand is inelastic ($-1 < E_{Q,P} < 0$), then $MR < 0$
-   If demand is unitary elastic ($E_{Q,P} = -1$), then $MR = 0$

### Profit Maximization

> [!rule] Monopolist's Profit Maximization
> A profit-maximizing monopolist produces output $Q^M$ such that
>
> $$
> \boxed{MR(Q^M) = MC(Q^M)}
> $$

### Pricing rule

> [!rule] Monopolist's Pricing Rule
> Given the optimal output $Q^M$, the monopolist **sets the price according to the demand curve**:
>
> $$
> \boxed{P^M = P(Q^M)}
> $$

### Absence of Supply Curve

A monopolist's market power implies that$$\boxed{P>MR}$$Furthermore, $MR=MC$ at the profit-maximizing output. Because this implies that $$\boxed{P>MC}$$there is **no supply curve for a monopolist**, because there is no one-to-one relationship between price and quantity supplied.

Same applies for markets served by a firms with market power (e.g., monopolistic competition, oligopoly).

>[!rule]
>A firm with market power has **<u>no supply curve</u>**
>- monopoly
>- monopolistic competition
>- oligopoly

### Deadweight Loss

> [!definition] Deadweight Loss (DWL)
> The **deadweight loss** is the **total surplus lost by society because the <u>monopolist produces less than the socially optimal output</u>**.

## Monopolistic Competition

A key difference between monopolistically _competitive_ and _perfectly_ competitive markets is that each firm produces a **slightly differentiated product**.

-   Products are close, but not perfect, substitutes
-   Firm's demand curve is **downward sloping** under monopolistic competition

> [!rule] Monopolistically Competitive Firm's output Rule
> A profit-maximizing monopolistically competitive firm produces the output $Q^{*}$ such that
>
> 1. $\boxed{P > MC}$ (because $MR=MC$ and $P>MR$)
> 2. $\boxed{P = ATC}$ in the long run
>
> -   because of free entry and exit
> -   but beware that $\boxed{P = ATC > \min ATC}$ because of excess capacity
