## Methods for Obtaining Inputs

-   **Spot exchange**: immediate purchase of inputs at current market prices
-   **Contracts**: formal relationship between buyer and seller that obligates the buyer and seller to exchange at terms specified in a legal document
-   **Vertical integration**: firm produces its own inputs

---

## Transaction Costs

> [!definition] Transaction Costs
> **Transaction costs** are the costs that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and following trough a bargain.
>
> They are the **cost** for acquiring an input **in excess of the price paid to the supplier**.

_E.g. search for supplier, cost of negotiation, investmets required to make the transaction happen, etc._

---

## Principal-Agent Problem

> [!definition] Principal-Agent Problem
> The **seperation of ownership and control** creates the **principal-agent (P-A) problem**.

Examples:

-   Owner (principal) hires manager (agent) to run the firm
-   Landlord (principal) hires tenant (agent) to take care of property
-   Tenant (principal) wants to pay as little energy costs as possible, landlord (agent) doesn't want to spend money on energy-saving improvements
-   Patient (principal) hires doctor (agent) to take care of health
-   Manager (principal) hires employee (agent) to work

### Solutions to the P-A Problem

In the case of owner-manager, the manager makes an economic trade-off: **effort vs. leisure**. We can incentivize the manager to work harder:

-   **Incentive contract**
    -   Tie manager wage to firm performance (e.g. profits)
-   **Outside forces**
    -   Reputation
    -   Takeover threat
-   **Profit sharing**
    -   Give manager a share of the firm's profits
-   **Revenue sharing**
    -   Give manager a share of the firm's revenues
-   **Time clocks and spot checks**
    -   Monitor the manager's work hours and performance

## 1. S $\leftrightarrow$ **STRUCTURE**

### Industry Concentration

> [!definition] Industry Concentration
> **Industry concentration** measures the size distribution of firms within an industry
>
> -   Many small firms?
> -   Few large firms?

> [!formula] Four-Firm Concentration Ratio ($C_4$)
>
> $$
> \boxed{C_4 = \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4}{S_T}}
> $$
>
> Where $S_i$ are the sales of the four _largest_ firms and $S_T$ is total industry sales.

> [!formula] Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
>
> $$
> \boxed{HHI = 10 000 \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(\frac{S_i}{S_T}\right)}
> $$

> [!rule] HHI Interpretation
> $$\boxed{\text{Highly concentrated} \iff HHI > 2 500}$$

### Potential for Entry

Optimal decisions by firms will depend on the ease with which new firms can enter the market. Serveral factors can create **barrriers to entry**:

-   Capital requirements
-   Patents
-   Economies of scale

---

## 2. C $\leftrightarrow$ **CONDUCT**

... of a firm refers to its **behaviour** in the marketplace.

### Pricing Strategies

> [!formula] Lerner Index
>
> $$
> \boxed{L = \frac{P - MC}{P}} \iff \boxed{P = \left(\frac{1}{1 - L}\right) MC}
> $$

The **Lerner Index** measures the **market power of a firm** by quantifying the difference between price and marginal cost as a proportion of price.

> [!formula] Markup Factor over Marginal Cost
>
> $$
> \boxed{\text{Markup Factor over MC} = \frac{1}{1 - L}}
> $$

### Integration and Merger Activity

> [!definition] Integration
> **Integration** is the process of **combining different stages of production** or uniting productive resources of firms. It can occur during the formation of a firm.
> It is a form of **vertical integration**.

_E.g. a car manufacturer acquiring a tire company._

> [!definition] Merger
> A **merger** is the combination of two or more firms into a single firm.
> It is a form of **horizontal integration**.

_E.g. two car manufacturers merging to form a larger company._

#### Types of Integration

-   **Vertical integration**: combining different stages of production
-   **Horizontal integration**: combining firms at the same stage of production

#### Reasons for Integration

-   Reduce transaction costs
-   Reap (= exploit) economies of _scale_ (LRAC $\downarrow$ as $Q \uparrow$)
-   Reap economies of _scope_ ($C(Q_1, Q_2) < C(Q_1, 0) + C(0, Q_2)$)
-   Increase market power
-   Gain better access to capital markets

### Other firm behaviours (conduct)

-   **Research and development**
    -   Expenditures made by firms to gain a technological advantage
    -   With the aim of acquiring a patent
-   **Advertising**
    -   Expenditures made by firms to inform or persuade consumers to purchase their product

---

## 3. P $\leftrightarrow$ **PERFORMANCE**

... refers to the **profits** and **social welfare** that result in a given **industry** (>< conduct was for one firm!).

---

## S-C-P Paradigm

$$\textbf{Structure} \to \textbf{Conduct} \to \textbf{Performance}$$

The SCP paradigm views these three aspects of industry as being integrally related.

-   **Structure**
    -   Industry concentration ($C_4$, HHI)
    -   Barriers to entry
-   **Conduct**
    -   Individual firm behavior on the market
    -   Pricing strategies (Lerner index, markup factor)
    -   Integration and merger activity
    -   Other firm behaviours (R&D, advertising)
-   **Performance**
    -   Profitability (accounting profit, economic profit)
    -   Social welfare (consumer surplus, producer surplus, total surplus)

### Critique on SCP

There is **no one-way causal link** among structure, conduct, and performance.

-   Firm conduct can affect market structure (e.g. mergers)
-   Market performance can affect market structure (e.g. high profits attract new firms, changing concentration)

## Absence of Market Failures

In **absence of market failures**, the competitive market outcome (= social optimum, equilibrium) is **efficient $\Rightarrow$ maximizes total surplus**.

## Externality as Market Failure

> [!definition] Externality
> An **externality** is a **type of market failure**.
> It is the **uncompensated impact** of **one person's actions** on the **well-being of a bystander.**

Externalities can be:

-   **Positive**
    -   Impact on bystander is beneficial
    -   E.g. vaccination, research
-   **Negative**
    -   Impact on bystander is adverse
    -   E.g. pollution, noise

### Supply and Demand

> [!formula] Supply is private cost
> $$\textbf{Supply} = \textbf{Private Cost}$$

> [!formula] Demand is private value
> $$\textbf{Demand} = \textbf{Private Value}$$

### Negative Externality

> [!formula] Social Cost in presence of _External Cost_
>
> $$\boxed{\textbf{Social Cost} = \textbf{Private Cost} + \textbf{External Cost}}$$

The **social cost** curve lies **above** the supply curve by the amount of the **external cost**.

![[images/5-external-cost.jpg]]

### Positive Externality

> [!formula] Social Value in presence of _External Benefit_
>
> $$\boxed{\textbf{Social Value} = \textbf{Private Value} + \textbf{External Benefit}}$$

The **social value** curve lies **above** the demand curve by the amount of the **external benefit**.

![[images/5-external-benefit.jpg]]

### Social Optimum

> [!rule] Social Optimum
> The **socially optimal quantity** is the quantity that maximizes **total surplus** <u>when accounting for the externality</u>. It is **shifted** by **externalities**.

### Internalizing the Externality

> [!definition] Internalizing the Externality
> Altering incentives so that people take account of the external effects of their actions.

_E.g. tax on pollution, subsidy for being vaccinated._

When market participants must pay social costs (= internalize the externality), **the market equilibrium is the social optimum**.

### Private Solutions to Externalities

> [!law] Coase Theorem
> If private parties can **bargain without cost** over the **allocation of resources**, they can **solve the externalities problem on their own**, no matter how the rights are initially distributed.

The socially efficient outcome maximizes everyone's well-being (total surplus).

### Why Private Solutions may not work

1. **Transaction costs**
    - Coase assumes no transaction costs
    - But in reality, transaction costs are often high
2. **Stubbornness**
    - Even if a beneficial agreement is possible, each party may hold out for a better deal
3. **Coordination problems**
    - If many parties are involved, it may be difficult to coordinate an agreement
