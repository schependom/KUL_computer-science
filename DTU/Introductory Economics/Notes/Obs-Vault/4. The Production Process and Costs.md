## Production Function

> [!definition] Production Function
> The **production function** is a mathematical function that defines the maximum amount of output that can be produced with a given set of inputs.
>
> -   $Q$ = level of **output**
> -   $K$ = quantity of **capital input**
> -   $L$ = quantity of **labor input**

> [!formula] Production Function
> $$ \boxed{Q = f(K,L)} $$

---

## Short Run vs. Long Run

> [!definition] Short Run
> The **short run** is the period of time where **some factors of production are fixed** (inputs) and constrain a manager's decisions.

> [!definition] Long Run
> The **long run** is the period of time where **<u>all factors of production are variable</u>** (inputs) and a manager can adjust all inputs.

---

## Measures of Productivity

### Total product

> [!definition] Total Product (TP)
> The **total product $TP$** is the **total output $Q$** produced with a given quantity of inputs.

### Average product

> [!definition] Average Product (AP)
> The **average product $AP$** is the total product $TP$ **divided by the quantity of inputs used**.

> [!formula] Average Product of labor ($AP_L$)
> $$ \boxed{AP_L = \frac{TP}{L}} $$

> [!formula] Average Product of capital ($AP_K$)
> $$ \boxed{AP_K = \frac{TP}{K}} $$

### Marginal product

> [!definition] Marginal Product (MP)
> The **marginal product $MP$** is the **additional output** produced by adding **one more unit of input**.

> [!law] Diminishing Marginal Product
> As more and more of an input is added, the marginal product of that input eventually declines, holding all other inputs constant.

> [!formula] Marginal Product of labor ($MP_L$)
> $$ \boxed{MP_L = \frac{\Delta TP}{\Delta L}} $$

> [!formula] Marginal Product of capital ($MP_K$)
> $$ \boxed{MP_K = \frac{\Delta TP}{\Delta K}} $$

### Graphical interpretation

-   Total, average and marginal product on the $y$-axis
-   Quantity of labor (or capital) on the $x$-axis

Total product:

-   Increasing at an increasing rate when $MP > AP$ (and $MP$ is increasing)
    -   "Increasing marginal returns to labor"
-   Increasing at a decreasing rate when $MP > AP$ (and $MP$ is decreasing)
    -   "Decreasing marginal returns to labor"
    -   Efficiency of adding more labor is decreasing
-   Maximum when $MP = 0$
    -   "Maximum total product"
-   Decreasing when $MP < 0$
    -   "Negative marginal returns to labor"
    -   Adding more labor decreases total product, because coordination problems arise.

## Maximising profits when labor and capital vary in the _short run_

### $VMP$'s for labour and capital

-   $w$ = **wage rate** (price of labor)
-   $r$ = **rental rate** (price of capital)

> [!formula] Value of Marginal Product of Labor ($VMP_L$)
> $$ \boxed{VMP_L = P \cdot MP_L} $$

This is the value of the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of **labor**.

> [!formula] Value of Marginal Product of Capital ($VMP_K$)
> $$ \boxed{VMP_K = P \cdot MP_K} $$

This is the value of the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of **capital**.

### Profit-maximization input usage

To maximize profits, use input levels at which **<u>marginal benefits equals marginal costs</u>**.

> [!rule] Profit Maximization Rule for Hiring Labor and Capital
> A firm should **hire <u>labor</u> up to the point** where $$\text{Profit maximized} \iff \boxed{VMP_L = w}$$ and **hire <u>capital</u> up to the point** where $$\text{Profit maximized} \iff \boxed{VMP_K = r}$$

## Algebraic Forms of Production Functions

### Linear

> [!formula] **Linear**
> $$ \boxed{Q = aK + bL} $$
> Where
>
> -   Marginal products:
>     -   $MP_K = a$
>     -   $MP_L = b$
> -   Average products:
>     -   $AP_K = \frac{aK + bL}{K}$
>     -   $AP_L = \frac{aK + bL}{L}$

### Leontief

> [!formula] **Leontief**
> $$ \boxed{Q = \min(aK, bL)} $$

_E.g. $Q = \min(2K, 3L)$ means that 2 units of capital and 3 units of labor are needed to produce 1 unit of output. If **either** input is **fixed**, the other input must be adjusted to maintain the desired level of output._

### Cobb-Douglas

> [!formula] **Cobb-Douglas**
> $$ \boxed{Q = K^\alpha L^\beta} $$
> Where
>
> -   Marginal products:
>     -   $MP_K = \alpha K^{\alpha - 1} L^\beta$
>     -   $MP_L = \beta K^\alpha L^{\beta - 1}$
> -   Average products:
>     -   $AP_K = K^{\alpha - 1} L^\beta$
>     -   $AP_L = K^\alpha L^{\beta - 1}$

## Isoquants and the Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)

> [!definition] Isoquant
> **Isoquants** capture the trade-off between combinations of inputs that yield the **same level of output** in the **<u>long run</u>**, when all inputs are variable.

-   $K$ on the $y$-axis
-   $L$ on the $x$-axis

> [!definition] Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)
> The **marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS)** is the rate at which a producer can **substitute between two inputs and keep the output level constant.**

> [!formula] Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)
>
> $$
> \boxed{MRTS_{KL} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}}
> $$
>
> and it is the **absolute value of the slope of the isoquant**.
>
> $$
> \boxed{MRTS_{KL} = \left| \frac{dK}{dL} \right|_{\text{on isoquant}}}
> $$

### Diminishing MRTS

> [!rule] Diminishing MRTS
> As a producer substitutes labor for capital (moves down along an isoquant), the MRTS
>
> -   Decreases
> -   The isoquant becomes flatter

---

## Isocost

> [!definition] Isocost Line
> An **isocost line** shows all **combinations of inputs** that yield the **same cost**.

> [!formula] Isocost Line
> $$ \boxed{C = wL + rK} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \boxed{K = \frac{C}{r} - \frac{w}{r}L}$$

-   For given input prices, isocosts **farther from the origin represent higher cost levels**.
-   Changes in input prices **change the slope** of the isocost line.

---

## Cost minimization

> [!definition] Cost Minimization
> Producing at the **lowest possible cost** for a **given level of output**.

> [!rule] Cost Minimization Rule
> Produce at a **given level of output** where the **marginal product per dollar spent** is **equal** for all inputs:
>
> $$
> \text{Cost for } Q_I \text{ minimized} \iff \boxed{\frac{MP_L}{w} = \frac{MP_K}{r}}
> $$
>
> Or equivalently,
>
> $$
> \text{Cost for } Q_I \text{ minimized} \iff \boxed{MRTS_{KL} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K} = \frac{w}{r}}
> $$

$\rightarrow$ SO: to minimize the cost of producing a given level of output $Q_I$, the firm should use **less of an input** and **more of other** inputs when that input's **price rises**.

---

## Cost Function

> [!definition] Cost Function
> Mathematical relationship that relates **cost** to the **cost-minimizing output** associated with an isoquant (=same level of output).

### Short-run costs

-   Fixed costs $FC$
-   Variable costs $VC(Q)$
-   Total costs $TC(Q)$

> [!formula] Short-run Cost Function
> $$ \boxed{TC(Q) = FC + VC(Q)} $$

### Long-run costs

> [!rule]
> -   In the long run, **all costs are variable**
> -   Since a manager is **free to adjust levels of all inputs**.
> -   So $FC = 0$ and $TC(Q) = VC(Q)$.

### Average costs

> [!formula] Average Costs
>
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \textbf{Average fixed cost (AFC)}& \quad \boxed{AFC = \frac{FC}{Q}} \\
> \textbf{Average variable cost (AVC)}& \quad \boxed{AVC = \frac{VC(Q)}{Q}} \\
> \textbf{Average total cost (ATC)}& \quad \boxed{ATC = \frac{TC(Q)}{Q} = AFC + AVC} \\
> \end{align*}
> $$

### Marginal cost

> [!definition] Marginal Cost (MC)
> The incremental cost of producing an additional unit of output.

> [!formula] Marginal Cost
> $$ \boxed{MC = \frac{dC}{dQ} = \frac{dVC(Q)}{dQ}} $$

![[images/4-average-marginal.jpg]]

_Note that the ATC's are **short-run** average total cost curves, because they depend on the level of fixed capital $K$. When the level of fixed capital $K$ changes, the ATC curve shifts. We can see this on the long-run $LRAC$ curve._

> [!rule] Minimum average cost
> The **marginal cost curve** intersects the **average total cost curve** at its **minimum point**.
>
> $$
> \boxed{\text{Minimum } ATC \iff MC = ATC}
> $$

Why?

-   $MC < ATC \implies TC$ is decreasing $\implies$ $ATC$ is decreasing.
-   $MC > ATC \implies TC$ is increasing $\implies$ $ATC$ is increasing.
-   $\frac{d ATC}{dQ} = 0 \iff \frac{d}{dQ} \left(\frac{C}{Q}\right) = 0 \iff = -\frac{1}{Q^2} C - \frac{1}{Q} MC = 0 \iff MC = ATC$.

---

## _Fixed_ vs. _Sunk_ Costs

> [!definition] Fixed Costs
> **Fixed costs** are costs that **do not vary with the level of output $Q$**.

> [!definition] Sunk Costs
> **Sunk costs** are costs that are **forever lost** after it has been paid.

_E.g. rent paid in advance_

> [!law] Irrelevance of Sunk Costs
> A decision maker should **ignore sunk costs to maximize profits or minimize losses**.

---

## Cubic Cost function

$$\boxed{C(Q) = F + aQ + bQ^2 + cQ^3}$$
where $F$ represents **fixed costs**, has marginal cost
$$MC(Q) = a + 2bQ + 3cQ^2$$

---

## _Long-Run_ Average Cost

For the $ATC$ in the **long run**, we denote it by **$LRAC$**.

![[images/4-lrac.jpg]]

-   **$LRAC$ curve** is **U-shaped**.
-   $ATC_0, ATC_1, ATC_2$ are **short-run average total cost curves** for different levels of fixed capital $K_0, K_1, K_2$.
-   The $LRAC$ shows the lowest average cost of producing each level of output when the firm can choose the level of capital.
-   All the short-run curves lie on or above the long-run curve because firms have **greater
    flexibility in the long run.**

![[images/4-lrac-2.jpg]]

## Economies of Scale

> [!definition] Economies of Scale
> Declining portion of the long-run average cost curve $LRAC$ where average cost decreases as output $Q$ increases.

> [!definition] Diseconomies of Scale
> Rising portion of the long-run average cost curve $LRAC$ where average cost increases as output $Q$ increases.

> [!definition] Constant Returns to Scale
> Portion of the long-run average cost curve that remains constant as output $Q$ increases.

![[images/4-economies-of-scale.jpg]]

---

## Economies of Scope

> [!rule] Economies of Scope
> Exist when the total cost of producing $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ together is less than the total cost of producing them separately:
>
> $$
> \text{Economies of Scope} \iff \boxed{C(Q_1,0) + C(0,Q_2) > C(Q_1,Q_2)}
> $$

---

## Cost Complementary

> [!rule] Cost Complementary
> Exist when the MC of producing one good decreases as the output of another good increases:
>
> $$
> \text{Cost Complementary} \iff \boxed{\frac{\partial MC_1(Q_1, Q_2)}{\partial Q_2} < 0 \text{ or } \frac{\partial MC_2(Q_1, Q_2)}{\partial Q_1} < 0}
> $$

---

## Algebraic Form of a Multiproduct Cost Function

$$\boxed{C(Q_1, Q_2) = f + a Q_1 Q_2 + (Q_1)^2 + (Q_2)^2}$$
where $f$ represents **fixed costs**, has marginal costs
$$MC_1(Q_1, Q_2) = a Q_2 + 2 Q_1$$
$$MC_2(Q_1, Q_2) = a Q_1 + 2 Q_2$$

$$
\begin{align*}
a < 0 &\implies \text{increase in } Q_2 \text{ decreases } MC_1 \\
&\implies \text{cost function exhibits cost complementary}
\end{align*}
$$

> [!rule] Cost Complementary
> $$\boxed{a < 0} \implies \text{cost function exhibits } \boxed{\textbf{cost complementary}}$$
>
> $$\boxed{a > 0} \implies \text{there are } \boxed{\textbf{no cost complementarities}}$$

> [!rule] Economies of Scope
> Economies of scope exist if $$\boxed{f > aQ_1Q_2}$$
