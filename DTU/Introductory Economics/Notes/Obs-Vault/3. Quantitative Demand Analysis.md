## Elasticity

> [!definition] Elasticity
> A measure of responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable.
> The **percentage change** in one variable resulting from a **1% change** in another variable.
> It is a **unit-free** measure.

> [!formula] General Formula for Elasticity
> In general, the elasticity between two variables $G$ and $S$ is given by:
>
> $$
> \boxed{E_{G,S} = \frac{\%\Delta G}{\%\Delta S}} = \frac{d G / G}{d S / S} = \boxed{\frac{d G}{d S} \cdot \frac{S}{G}}
> $$

## Own Price Elasticity of Demand

> [!definition] Price Elasticity of Demand
> The **price elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of a percentage change in quantity demanded of a good $X$ to a 1% change in its own price $P_X$.

> [!formula] Price Elasticity of Demand
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,P_X} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_X^d}{\%\Delta P_X} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_X} \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d}}$$
> By **law of demand**,
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,P_X} < 0}$$

> [!rule] Categories of Price Elasticity of Demand
>
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \textbf{Elastic demand}:&& |E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| > 1 \\
> \textbf{Unitary elastic demand}:&& |E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| = 1 \\
> \textbf{Inelastic demand}:&& |E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| < 1 \\
> \end{align*}
> $$

> [!rule]
> - A **necessity** good is in**elastic**: $$|E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| < 1$$
> - A **luxury** good is **elastic**: $$|E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| > 1$$

### Graphical Interpretation (demand curve)

The price elasticity of demand is closely related to the slope of the demand curve.

> [!rule]
> The **flatter** the curve, the **bigger** the elasticity (in absolute value).
> The **steeper** the curve, the **smaller** the elasticity (in absolute value).

> [!rule]
>
> **<u>Horizontal</u>** demand curve
>
> -   $E_{Q_X^d,P_X} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_X} \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d} = -\infty$
> -   **Perfectly <u>elastic</u> demand**
> -   Horizontal demand curve
>
> **<u>Vertical</u>** demand curve
>
> -   $E_{Q_X^d,P_X} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_X} \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d} = 0$
> -   **Perfectly <u>inelastic</u> demand**
> -   Vertical demand curve

!! Note that **elasticity varies along a linear demand curve** !!

### Factors affecting Price Elasticity of Demand

>[!rule] Factors affecting Elasticity of Demand
>
>1. **Availability of substitutes**:
>    - **More substitutes $\to$ more elastic** demand
>        - Because consumers can easily switch to another good if the price of the good rises
>    - _Broad_ vs _narrow_ definition
>        - **Narrowly defined $\to$ more elastic** demand because more substitutes
>        - **Broadly defined $\to$ more inelastic **demand because fewer substitutes
>2. **Time horizon**:
>    - E.g. gasoline
>        - **Short run: inelastic** demand because few substitutes
>        - **Long run: elastic** demand because more substitutes (e.g. electric cars, public transport)
>3. **Necessities vs luxuries**:
>    - **Necessities $\to$ inelastic** demand
>    - **Luxuries $\to$ elastic** demand
>    - _E.g. insulin vs vacations_
>4. **Expenditure share**:
>    - Small expenditure share $\to$ inelastic demand
>    - Large expenditure share $\to$ elastic demand (price increase of a good with a large expenditure share significantly affects the consumer's budget, leading to a larger change in quantity demanded.)
>    - _E.g. salt vs cars_

## Price Elasticity and Total Revenue

Recall that
$$ \text{Total Revenue} = P \times Q^d $$
The effect of a price change on total revenue **depends on the price elasticity of demand**.

> [!rule] Effect of Price Change on Total Revenue
> Demand $D$ is **<u>elastic</u>**
>
> -   $|E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| > 1$
> -   Price increase leads to a decrease in total revenue
> -   $\boxed{\text{Price} \uparrow \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{Total Revenue} \downarrow}$
>
> Demand $D$ is **<u>inelastic</u>**
>
> -   $|E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| < 1$
> -   Price increase leads to an increase in total revenue
> -   $\boxed{\text{Price} \uparrow \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{Total Revenue} \uparrow}$
>
> Demand $D$ is **<u>unitary elastic</u>**
>
> -   $|E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| = 1$
> -   **Total revenue is <u>maximized</u>**
> -   $\boxed{\text{Price} \uparrow \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{Total Revenue} \text{ unchanged}}$

>[!rule]
>Total revenue is maximized if $D$ is unitary elastic!

## Cross-Price Elasticity

> [!definition] Cross-Price Elasticity
> The **cross-price elasticity** measures the responsiveness of a percentage change in quantity demanded of a good $X$ to a 1% change in the price of another good $Y$.

> [!formula] Cross-Price Elasticity
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_X^d}{\%\Delta P_Y} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_Y} \cdot \frac{P_Y}{Q_X^d}}$$

> [!rule] Categories of Cross-Price Elasticity
> $X$ and $Y$ are:
>
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \textbf{Substitutes}:&& E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} > 0 \\
> \textbf{Complements}:&& E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} < 0 \\
> \textbf{Unrelated goods}:&& E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} = 0 \\
> \end{align*}
> $$

## Income Elasticity

> [!definition] Income Elasticity
> The **income elasticity** measures the responsiveness of a percentage change in quantity demanded of a good $X$ to a 1% change in **income $M$.**

> [!formula] Income Elasticity
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,M} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_X^d}{\%\Delta M}}$$

> [!rule] Categories of Income Elasticity
> Good $X$ is:
>
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \textbf{Normal good}:&& E_{Q_X^d,M} > 0 \\
> \textbf{Inferior good}:&& E_{Q_X^d,M} < 0 \\
> \end{align*}
> $$

## Other Elasticities

> [!definition] (Own) Advertising Elasticity
> The **(own) advertising elasticity** of demand for good $X$ is the ratio of the percentage change in the consumption of $X$ to the percentage change in advertising expenditure on $X$.

> [!definition] Cross-Advertising Elasticity between Goods $X$ and $Y$
> The **cross-advertising elasticity** between goods $X$ and $Y$ would measure the percentage change in the consumption of good $X$ resulting from a 1% change in advertising expenditure on good $Y$.

## Elasticities for (Non-)Linear Demand Functions

### Linear Demand Function

Given a linear demand function:
$$Q_X^d = \alpha_0 + \alpha_X P_X + \alpha_Y P_Y + \alpha_M M + \alpha_H H$$

We have

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Own price elasticity: } & \alpha_X \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d} \\
\textbf{Cross-price elasticity: } & \alpha_Y \cdot \frac{P_Y}{Q_X^d} \\
\textbf{Income elasticity: } & \alpha_M \cdot \frac{M}{Q_X^d} \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Log-Linear Demand Function

One non-linear demand function is the **log-linear demand function**:
$$ \boxed{\ln Q_X^d = \beta_0 + \beta_X \ln P_X + \beta_Y \ln P_Y + \beta_M \ln M + \beta_H \ln H} $$

We have

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Own price elasticity: } & \beta_X \\
\textbf{Cross-price elasticity: } & \beta_Y \\
\textbf{Income elasticity: } & \beta_M \\
\end{align*}
$$

## Econometrics

> [!definition] Econometrics
> Econometrics is about how we can use theory and data from economics, business and the social sciences, along with tools from statistics, to **answer "how much" questions**.

An economic model consists of

-   **systematic part**
-   **random, unpredictable component** $e$ = **random error**

## Linear Regression

Trivial.
