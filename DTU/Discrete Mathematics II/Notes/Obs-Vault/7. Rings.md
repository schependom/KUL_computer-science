## 7.1 Definition of a ring

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.1
> A **ring** $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is a set $R$ equipped with **two** binary **operations** $$+_R : R \times R \to R \qquad \text{and} \qquad \cdot_R : R \times R \to R$$
> such that the following axioms hold:
>
> 1. $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian group** (the _additive_ group). The identity element of this group is denoted by $0_R$.
> 2. There exists an **identity element** $1_R$ for the operation $\cdot_R$ such that for all $x \in R$, we have
>    $$x \cdot_R 1_R = 1_R \cdot_R x = x.$$
> 3. The operation $\cdot_R$ is **associative**: for all $x, y, z \in R$, we have
>    $$(x \cdot_R y) \cdot_R z = x \cdot_R (y \cdot_R z).$$
> 4. The operations $+_R$ and $\cdot_R$ satisfy the **distributive laws**: for all $x, y, z \in R$, we have
>    $$x \cdot_R (y +_R z) = (x \cdot_R y) +_R (x \cdot_R z)$$
>    and
>    $$(x +_R y) \cdot_R z = (x \cdot_R z) +_R (y \cdot_R z).$$

> [!exercise] Ex. 7.11: Identity elements
> The only ring in which $1_R = 0_R$ is the zero-ring $(\{0_R\}, +_R, \cdot_R)$.

> [!exam] One element $\neq$ zero element
>
> $$
> R \neq \{0_R\} \implies \boxed{1_R \neq 0_R}
> $$

It is **not** necessary to assume that $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian** group: If $(R, +_R)$ is a non-necessarily-abelian group, then the other ring axioms would imply that for all $x, y \in R$, $x +_R y = y +_R x$.

> [!exercise] Ex. 7.11
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. Then
>
> 1. $\forall x \in R :\quad \boxed{x \cdot_R 0_R = 0_R \cdot_R x = 0_R}$
> 2. $\boxed{0_R \neq 1_R} \quad$ unless $R$ is the zero-ring $(\{0_R\}, +_R, \cdot_R)$.

> -   If $u$ is a unit, then so is $-u$:$$\red{\mathbf{!}} \quad \boxed{u \in R^* \implies -u \in R^*} \quad \red{\mathbf{!}}$$

From this we deduce that $(-1_R) \cdot_R (-1_R) = 1_R$ and thus any positive power $m$ of $-1_R$ is given by $$(-1_R)^m = \begin{cases}1_R &\text{if } m \text{ is even}\\-1_R &\text{if } m \text{ is odd}\end{cases}.$$

> [!definition] Commutative ring
> A ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is called a **commutative ring** if the operation $\cdot_R$ is commutative.

Examples of commutative rings are $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $R \in \{\Z, \Q, \R, \C\}$.

> [!exam] Powers in a commutative ring
> In a **commutative** ring, for any $x,y \in R$ and any $n \in \Z_{\geq 0}$, we have

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.5: Units and the set $R^*$ of units
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. An element $x \in R$ is called a **unit** if there exists an element $y \in R$ such that
> $$\boxed{x \cdot_R y = y \cdot_R x = 1_R}$$
> The set of all units in $R$ is denoted by $R^*$:
> $$\boxed{R^* := \{ x \in R \mid \exists y \in R : x \cdot_R y = y \cdot_R x = 1_R \}}$$

In other words: the set $R^*$ consists of all elements $x$ from $R$ having a multiplicative inverse.
Just as for groups, **multiplicative inverses** (if they exist) **are** <b style="color:red">unique</b> and one writes $x^{-1}$ for this
inverse.

> [!lemma] Lemma 7.1.6: The group $(R^*, \cdot_R)$
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. Then
> $$\boxed{(R^*, \cdot_R) \textbf{ is a group}} \text{ with identity element } 1_R.$$

_Example_: consider the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$. The units in this ring are $1$ and $5$.

We already showed in Chapter 3 that $(\Z_6, \cdot_6)$ is not a group, because $2, 3, 4$ do not have multiplicative inverses. However, we defined the group $((\Z_n)^*, \cdot_n)$ in Chapter 3 with
$$(\Z_n)^* = \{ z \in \Z_n \mid \gcd(z, n) = 1 \}.$$
Now we see that this group is precisely the group of units of the ring $(\Z_n, +_n, \cdot_n)$:
$$(\Z_n)^* = \Z_n^*.$$
So, for the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$, we have $\Z_6^* = \{1, 5\}$.

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.11: Zero-divisor
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. An element $x \in R$ is called a **zero-divisor** if
> $$ \boxed{x\neq 0_R} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\exists y \in R \setminus \{0_R\} : x \cdot_R y = 0_R \, \lor \, y \cdot_R x = 0_R}$$

**WARNING**: For rings $R$ with at least one zero-divisor, then
$$x \cdot_R y = 0_R \quad \centernot\implies \quad x = 0_R \, \lor \, y = 0_R$$
This <b style="color:red"><u>cancellation rule</u> only</b> holds in rings without zero-divisors, i.e. in <b style="color:red"><u>integral domains</u></b>!

> [!deduction]
> A ring has **no zero-divisors** if and only if for all $x, y \in R$,

> or equivalently,
> $$(x \cdot_R y) = 0_R \implies (x = 0_R \lor y = 0_R).$$

> [!exercise] Exercise 7.17: A unit is not a zero-divisor
> Let $u \in R^*$ be a unit in the ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$. Then **$u$ is not a zero-divisor.**

Because of this fact, we conclude that:

>
> $$
> \boxed{\textbf{Every field is an integral domain.}}

To prove that for a field $(R, +, \cdot)$, with $R^* = R \setminus \{0\}$, there can be a zero-divisor, we would need to find $x, y \in R \setminus \{0\}$ such that $x \cdot y = 0$. But this is impossible because both $x$ and $y$ are units (by definition of a field) and thus not zero-divisors (by the exercise above).

> [!proposition] Proposition 7.1.15

> Boolean rings have characteristic 2, since $1_R = -1_R \implies \underbrace{1_R +_R 1_R}_{2 \text{ times}} = 0_R$.

Why is $1_R = -1_R$ in a boolean ring? Because
$$1_R = 1_R \cdot_R 1_R = (-1_R) \cdot_R (-1_R) = -1_R.$$

## 7.2 Domains and fields

> [!definition] Integral domain
> An **integral <u>domain</u>** is a **commutative** ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ with **<u>no zero-divisors</u>**.

Examples of integral domains are $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $R \in \{\Z, \Q, \R, \C\}$.

Note that we now leave out the $R$ subscripts for the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ when there is no risk of confusion.

> [!proposition] Proposition 7.2.1
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be an (integral) domain (i.e. a commutative ring without zero-divisors).
> $$\boxed{x \cdot y = 0 \implies x = 0 \lor y = 0}$$
> Consequently,
> $$\boxed{x \cdot y = x \cdot z \quad \land \quad x \neq 0 \quad \implies \quad y = z}$$
> So we see that
> $$\boxed{\textbf{The cancellation law holds in domains.}}$$

Why does the cancellation law hold in domains? Assume that $x, y, z \in R$ such that $x \cdot y = x \cdot z$ and $x \neq 0$. Then
$$x \cdot y - x \cdot z = 0 \implies x \cdot (y - z) = 0.$$
Because there are no zero-divisors in $R$ and $x \neq 0$, we must have that $y - z = 0$, so $y = z$.

> [!definition] Definition 7.2.4: Field
> A **field** is a **commutative** ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ such that
> $$\boxed{R^* = R \setminus \{0\}}$$

Examples of fields are $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $R \in \{\Q, \R, \C\}$.

Note that $$\boxed{(\Z, +, \cdot) \textbf{ is not a field}}$$because not every non-zero integer has a multiplicative inverse in $\Z$! In fact, $\boxed{\Z^* = \{1, -1\}} \neq \Z \setminus \{0\}$.

> [!fact] Fields
> If $(R, +, \cdot)$ is a field, then
>
> 1. every $x \in R \setminus \{0\}$ admits a multiplicative inverse for $\cdot_R$
> 2. $(R \setminus \{0\}, \cdot_R)$ is a group

In fact, $(R \setminus \{0\}, \cdot_R)$ is an abelian group because the ring is commutative!

_Why are fields always integral domains?_

> Assume that $(R, +, \cdot)$ is a field and let $x, y \in R$ such that $$x \cdot y = 0$$If $x \neq 0$, then $x$ is a unit (by definition of a field) and thus has a multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$. Multiplying both sides of the equation $x \cdot y = 0$ by $x^{-1}$ gives $$x^{-1} \cdot (x \cdot y) = x^{-1} \cdot 0 \implies 1 \cdot y = 0 \implies y = 0.$$Because there exists no $y \neq 0$ such that $x \cdot y = 0$, we conclude that $x$ is not a zero-divisor. By symmetry, the same argument applies if $y \neq 0$. Therefore, a field has no zero-divisors and is thus an integral domain.

> where $\text{GF}(p)$ stands for **Galois Field** (_Évariste Galois_).

We write $\F_p$ instead of $\Z_p$ to emphasize that it is a **field** rather than just a ring.

_Why is $(\Z_p, +_p, \cdot_p)$ a field?_ Because if $p$ is a prime, $$\begin{align}\Z_p^* &= \{p \in \Z_p \mid \text{gcd}(p, n) = 1\} \\ &= \Z_p \setminus \{0\} &&\text{because the only divisor of } p \text{ is } 1 \text{ and } p \text{ itself.}\end{align}$$ so every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse and thus $\Z_p$ is a field.

## 7.3 Polynomials with coefficients in a commutative ring

We will assume that $$(R, +_R, \cdot_R) \text{ is a } \textbf{commutative ring}.$$

> [!definition] Definition 7.3.1: Polynomial with coefficients in $R$
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a (commutative) ring. A **polynomial $p(X)$ with coefficients in $R$** is a formal expression of the form
> $$p(X) = r_0 + r_1 X + r_2 X^2 + \cdots + r_d X^d$$
> where $d \in \Z_{\geq 0}$ and $r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_d \in R$.

> If $r_d \neq 0$, then the **degree** of $p(X)$ is defined as
> $$\deg(p(X)) = d,$$
> and $r_d$ is called the **leading coefficient**.

> [!notation] Convention
> The coefficient of $X^i$ for $i > d$ is assumed to be $0_R$. In other words, we can write any polynomial $p(X)$ as

> $$

>
> If a term $r_i X^i$ has coefficient $r_i = 0_R$, then it is omitted.

> [!definition] Monic polynomial
> A polynomial $p(X) \in R[X]$ is called **monic** if its leading coefficient is $\boxed{r_d = 1_R}$.

For example, $p(X) = r_0 + r_1 X + \ldots + X^d$ is monic.

> [!definition] Zero polynomial
> If $p(X) = 0_R$, then $p(X)$ is called the **zero polynomial** and its degree is defined as
> $$\boxed{\deg(0_R) = -\infty}$$

> [!definition] Set of polynomials $R[X]$
> The **set of all polynomials** with coefficients in the ring $R$ is denoted by
> $$\boxed{R[X]} := \{ p(X) \mid p(X) \text{ is a polynomial with coefficients in } R \}.$$

**WARNING**: Be careful <u>not</u> to think of $p(X)$ as a map $p: R \to R$!
However, we can define an evaluation of $p(X)$ at a point $a \in R$ as follows:

$$p(a) = r_0 + r_1 a + r_2 a^2 + \cdots + r_d a^d \in R$$

> [!definition] Evaluation map
> The **evaluation map** at a point $a \in R$ is the map
>
> $$
> p \begin{cases}R &\to R\\ a &\mapsto p(a)\end{cases}
> $$

We have the risk of treating two different polynomials as the same if we think of them as maps.
However, **two distinct polynomials can have the same evaluation at all points in $R$**.

Consider for example $R = \Z_2 = \{0, 1\}$ and the two polynomials
$$p_1(X) = X \quad \text{and} \quad p_2(X) = X^2.$$
Then we have
$$p_1 \begin{cases}0 &\mapsto 0\\1 &\mapsto 1\end{cases} \quad \text{and} \quad p_2 \begin{cases}0 &\mapsto 0^2 = 0 \cdot_2 0 = 0\\1 &\mapsto 1^2 = 1 \cdot_2 1 = 1\end{cases}$$
So, both polynomials have the same evaluation at all points in $\Z_2$, even though they are different polynomials!

In general, a polynomial is <b style="color:red;">uniquely determined by its coefficients</b>. In other words, two polynomials $p(X) = \sum_{i=0}^d r_i X^i$ and $q(X) = \sum_{i=0}^e s_i X^i$ are equal if and only if $d = e$ and $r_i = s_i$ for all $i = 0, 1, \ldots, d$.

We can give a ring structure to $R[X]$ by defining addition and multiplication of polynomials.

> [!definition] Definition 7.3.4: Addition and multiplication of polynomials
> Let $p(X), q(X) \in R[X]$ be two polynomials defined as above:
> $$p(X) = \sum_{i=0}^d r_i X^i \quad \text{and} \quad q(X) = \sum_{i=0}^e s_i X^i.$$

>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> p(X) + q(X) &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty (r_j + s_j) X^j &=& \sum_{\ell=0}^{\max(d, e)} (r_\ell + s_\ell) X^\ell \\
> p(X) \cdot q(X) &= \sum_{i=0}^\infty \left(\sum_{j=0}^i r_j s_{i-j}\right) X^{i} &=& \sum_{\ell=0}^{d+e} \left( \sum_{i=0}^{\ell} r_i s_{\ell-i} \right) X^\ell
> \end{align}
> $$

For example, $$(r_i X^i) \cdot (s_j X^j) = (r_i \cdot s_j) X^{i+j},$$but it is <b style="color:red;">not always true</b> that $$\deg(p(X) \cdot q(X)) = \deg(p(X)) + \deg(q(X)).$$This, in fact, **does** hold if $R$ is an integral domain (Theorem 7.3.7).

> [!definition] Definition 7.3.5: The polynomial ring $(R[X], +, \cdot)$

It is tempting to say that $\deg(p(X) \cdot q(X)) = \deg(p(X)) + \deg(q(X))$, but this is **not** true in general. Clearly, it holds that $\deg(p(X) \cdot q(X)) \leq \deg(p(X)) + \deg(q(X))$, because the highest possible degree in the product $p(X) \cdot q(X)$ is $d + e$. To see what $\deg(p(X) \cdot q(X))$ really is, we have a look at the coefficient of the leading term $X^{d+e}$ in the product $p(X) \cdot q(X)$:
$$\text{coefficient of } X^{d+e} = \sum_{j=0}^{d+e} r_j s_{(d+e)-j} = \boxed{r_d s_e}.$$

-   $\boxed{j > d}$: $r_j = 0$, so $r_j s_{(d+e)-j} = 0$,
-   $\boxed{j < d}$: $d-j>0 \Rightarrow e + (d-j) > e$, so $s_{(d+e)-j} = 0$ and thus $r_j s_{(d+e)-j} = 0$,
-   $\boxed{j = d}$: this is the only term that remains, so the coefficient of $X^{d+e}$ in $p(X) \cdot q(X)$ is $r_d s_e$.

The only way for the degree of the product $p(X) \cdot q(X)$ to be **less** than $d + e$ is if $r_d s_e = 0$. Because $\deg(p(X)) = d$, $r_d$ can't be zero. Completely analogously, $s_e$ can't be zero either. So the only way for $r_d s_e = 0$ is if at least one of $r_d$ or $s_e$ is a zero-divisor. This cannot be the case if $(R, +, \cdot)$ is an integral domain, because then there are no zero-divisors.

We conclude that

## 7.4 Division with remainder for polynomials

> [!theorem] Theorem 7.4.1: Division with remainder for polynomials over a commutative ring
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a commutative ring and let $p(X), q(X) \in R[X]$ be two polynomials different from zero. Assume that $d(X)$ is **<u style="color:red;">monic</u>** (i.e. its leading coefficient is $1_R$). Then there exist polynomials $q(X), r(X) \in R[X]$ such that
>
> 1. $p(X) = d(X) \cdot q(X) + r(X)$
> 2. $\deg(r(X)) < \deg(d(X))$

What if $d(X)$ is not monic? In that case, we can multiply both sides of the equation $p(X) = d(X) \cdot q(X) + r(X)$ by the multiplicative inverse of the leading coefficient of $d(X)$ (if it exists).

We defined the degree of the zero polynomial as $-\infty$ so that the condition $\deg(r(X)) < \deg(d(X))$ automatically holds.

The proof of this theorem gives an algorithm to compute the quotient and remainder polynomials $q(X)$ and $r(X)$. When performing this **division algorithm**, one ends up with a schematic following the following form:

**Finding a root of a polynomial $p(X) \in \Z_n[X]$**

For $a\in \Z_n$ to be a root of $p(X) \in \Z_n[X]$, we need to have
$$p(a) = r_0 +_n r_1 a +_n r_2 a^2 +_n \cdots +_n r_d a^d = 0_{\Zn} = 0$$
It holds that $a^i = \underbrace{a \cdot_n a \cdots \cdot_n a}_{i \text{ times}}$.

> Let $(D, +, \cdot)$ be an integral **domain** (or a field) and let $p(X) \in D[X]$ be a **non-zero** polynomial. Then $$\boxed{\deg(p(X)) = n \quad \implies \quad p(X) \textbf{ has at most $n$ distinct roots in $D$}}$$

Since Corollary 7.4.4 holds for any integral **domain**, <u>it also holds for <b>fields</b></u>, since fields are integral domains.

The proof of 7.4.4 uses the **cancellation rule for domains**, so Corollary 7.4.4 holds for any integral domain, but it is in general **not** true if $(D, +, \cdot)$ has zero-divisors (and thus is not an integral domain).

_Example_: consider $2X \in \Z_4[X]$. Note that $\Z_4$ has zero-divisors and hence is not an integral domain. The polynomial $2X$ has degree 1, but it has two distinct roots in $\Z_4$, namely $0$ and $2$, since $2 \cdot 0 = 0$ and $2 \cdot 2 = 4 \equiv 0 \mod 4$.

Why is $Z(R)=R$ if and only if $R$ is a commutative ring? If $Z(R) = R$, then for all $r_1, r_2 \in R$, we have that $r_1 \in Z(R)$ and thus $r_1 \cdot_R r_2 = r_2 \cdot_R r_1$, so the ring is commutative. Conversely, if the ring is commutative, then for all $z \in R$ and all $r \in R$, we have that $z \cdot_R r = r \cdot_R z$, so $z \in Z(R)$ and thus $Z(R) = R$.
