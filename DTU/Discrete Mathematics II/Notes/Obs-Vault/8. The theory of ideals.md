## 8.1 Ring homomorphisms and ideals

From now on, we will only consider **commutative rings**.

Ideals in ring theory play a similar role as normal subgroups in group theory and are used to construct **quotient rings**.

We have seen that $\text{ker}(\varphi)$ of a group homomorphism $\varphi: G_1 \to G_2$ is a **normal** subgroup of $G_1$. That's why we start by studying ring homomorphisms and their kernels.

> [!definition] Definition 8.1.1: Ring homomorphism

> 2. $\boxed{\varphi(1_R) = 1_S}$
> 3. $\boxed{\varphi(r \cdot_R s) = \varphi(r) \cdot_S \varphi(s)}$ for all $r, s \in R$

**Example**: $\psi : \begin{cases}\Z \to \Zn\\ a \mapsto a \bmod n\end{cases} \,$ is a ring homomorphism from $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ to $(\Zn, +_n, \cdot_n)$.

It says that you can perform the addition and multiplication operations before or after taking the modulus, and the result is the same. We already saw this in Corollary 1.3.8:
$$\forall a,b \in \Z: a +_n b = (a + b) \bmod n = ((a \bmod n) + (b \bmod n)) \bmod n$$
Which is equivalent to
$$\psi(a + b) = \psi(a) +_n \psi(b).$$
Similarly for multiplication:
$$\forall a,b \in \Z: a \cdot_n b = (a \cdot b) \bmod n = ((a \bmod n) \cdot (b \bmod n)) \bmod n$$
Which is equivalent to
$$\psi(a \cdot b) = \psi(a) \cdot_n \psi(b).$$

> [!definition] Ring Isomorphism
> A **ring isomorphism** is a **bijective** ring homomorphism $\varphi: R \to S$.

A rich source of ring homomorphisms comes from the evaluation of polynomials of subrings $R \subseteq S$ in points of the larger rings $S$.

> [!definition] Definition: Subring
> Let $(S, +, \cdot)$ be a ring. Then $R$ is a **subring** of $S$ if

> -   $0_R = 0_S$
> -   $1_R = 1_S$
> -   we restrict the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ of $S$ to $R$, making $(R, +, \cdot)$ a ring.

In such a setting, a polynomial $p(X) \in R[X]$ is also a polynomial in $S[X]$. Thus, we can define the evaluation of $p(X)$ at a point $a \in S$.

_Example_: $\Z$ is a subring of $(\R, +, \cdot)$. Because a polynomial $p(X) \in \Z[X]$ is also a polynomial in $\R[X]$, we can define the evaluation of $p(X)$ at a point $a \in \R$.

>
> $$
> \psi : \begin{cases}R[X] \to S\\ p(X) \mapsto p(a)\end{cases}
> $$
>
> is a **ring homomorphism**.

_Example_: $R = \Z$ is a subring of $(S, +, \cdot) = (\C, +, \cdot)$. Choosing $a = \sqrt{2} \in \C$, we get the ring homomorphism
$$\psi : \begin{cases}\Z[X] \to \C\\ p(X) \mapsto p(\sqrt{2})\end{cases}$$which is not a ring isomorphism since it is not injective ($\psi(2)=2=\psi(X^2)$).

By Theorem 6.1.9, $\ker(\varphi)$ is a **normal** subgroup of the group $(R, +_R)$. However, by the definition of a ring (Definition 7.1.1), $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian** group, so $$\boxed{\textbf{every subgroup of } (R, +_R) \textbf{ is automatically normal}}$$Thus, we conclude that $\ker(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +_R)$.

> [!theorem] Theorem 8.1.6: Properties of the kernel of a ring homomorphism
> Let $\varphi: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then its kernel $\ker(\varphi)$ has the following properties:
>
> 1. $\ker(\varphi) \subseteq R$ is a (normal) **subgroup** of the **additive group** $(R, +_R)$ of the ring $R$.
> 2. $\forall r \in R, \forall x \in \ker(\varphi): \quad \boxed{r \cdot_R x \in \ker(\varphi)}.$

Examples:

1. Trivial ideals: $$\{0_R\} \text{ and } R$$
2. In the ring $(\Z, +, \cdot)$:$$\boxed{I = n\Z = \{n \cdot k \mid k \in \Z\} \text{ is an ideal for any integer } n}$$
    - $I$ is a subgroup of $(\Z, +)$, because $I = n\Z = \gen{n}$ (the subgroup generated by $n$)
    - We show that $\forall x \in I, \forall r \in \Z: \boxed{r \cdot x \in I}$. Take any $x \in n\Z$. Then there exists $k \in \Z$ such that $x = n \cdot k$. Thus, for any $r \in \Z$, we have that$$r \cdot x = r \cdot (n \cdot k) = n \cdot (r \cdot k) \in n\Z = I$$because $\Z$ is **commutative**.

> [!fact] Every ideal contains $0_R$
> Let $I$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$. Then
> $$\boxed{0_R \in I}$$

This is because $I$ is a subgroup of the group $(R, +_R)$, and thus contains the identity element $0_R$ of this group.

> [!exam]

> $$
> \boxed{x \in I \implies \gen{x} \subseteq I}

Proof: $\gen{x} \eqDef \{x \cdot_R r \mid r \in R\} = \{r \cdot_R x \mid r \in R\}$. By the definition of an ideal, $\forall r \in R: r \cdot_R x \in I$. Thus, $\gen{x} \subseteq I$.

> [!exercise] Exercise 8.10: Intersection of Ideals
> The **intersection** $I \cap J$ of two ideals $I,J$ of a commutative ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is again an **ideal** of $R$.

However, the union $I \cup J$ of two ideals $I,J$ of a commutative ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is in general **not** an ideal of $R$.
Consider, for example, $I = 2\Z = \gen{2}$ and $J = 3\Z = \gen{3}$, which are both ideals of the ring $(\Z, +, \cdot)$. Now, it holds that $2 \in I$ and $3 \in J$, but $2 + 3 = 5 \notin I \cup J$. Thus, $I \cup J$ is not closed under addition and therefore not an ideal of $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ (it is not even a subgroup of $(\Z, +)$).

> [!deduction] The kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal
> Let $\varphi: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then its **kernel $\ker(\varphi)$ is an ideal** of the ring $R$.

**Trivial ideals** of the commutative ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ are $\{0_R\}$ and $R$ itself.
In fact, these trivial ideals are **principal ideals**, since $\{0_R\} = \gen{0_R}$ and $R = \gen{1_R}$:

> [!exam] Exercise 8.6
> If an ideal $I \subseteq R$ contains a **unit** $u \in R^*$, then $I = R$.
>
> $$
> \exists u \in R^* : \boxed{u \in I \implies I = R}
> $$

For example, if $1_R \in I$, then for any $r \in R$, we have that $r = r \cdot_R 1_R \in I$ by the definition of an ideal. Thus, $I = R$.

So, if we want to <b style="color:red">find non-trivial ideals</b>, we have to look for ideals that **<u style="color:red">do not contain any units</u>**.

The proof of the more general case for any unit $u \in R^*$ is as follows: assume that $u \in I$ then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\forall r \in R : r \cdot u^{-1} \in R \quad &\implies r \cdot u^{-1} \cdot u \in I && \text{(by definition of ideal, since $u \in I$)}\\
&\implies r \in I && \text{(since $u^{-1} \cdot u = 1_R$)}
\end{aligned}
$$

It turns out that any ideal in the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$ is a principal ideal. **<u>Lagrange's theorem</u>** says that the subgroup $I \subseteq (\Z_6, +_6)$ has order $|I|$ dividing $6$. Thus, $|I| \in \{1,2,3,6\}$. The subgroups of these orders are $\{0\}$, $\{0,3\}$, $\{0,2,4\}$ and $\Z_6$ itself. One can check that these are also ideals of the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$:

-   $\{0\} = \gen{0}$
-   $\{0,3\} = \gen{3}$
-   $\{0,2,4\} = \gen{2}$
-   $\Z_6 = \gen{1}$

-   An example of a principal ideal ring is $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$
-   Consider the ring $(\Z, +, \cdot)$. Then the congruence class $n\Z$ is a principal ideal of $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ generated by $n$:
    $$
    \gen{n} = n\Z = \{\ldots, -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, \ldots\}.
    $$

Even if a finitely generated ring doesn't look like a principal ideal ring, it might still be one. For example, consider the ideal $\gen{5,7} \subseteq \Z$ generated by $5$ and $7$. It turns out that this ideal is actually equal to the principal ideal $\gen{1} = \Z$, because $5$ and $7$ are relatively prime.

> [!lemma] Lemma 8.1.15 (p166)

The proof makes use of **Bézout's identity** from the _Extended_ Euclidean algorithm:

> [!exam] Bézout's identity and the Extended Euclidean algorithm
> $$\exists s,r \in \Z : \boxed{\text{gcd}(n,m) = d = s \cdot n + r \cdot m}$$

In fact, in the next section, we will see that **any ideal $I\subseteq \Z$** is a **principal** ideal, i.e. $$\exists n \in \Z : I = \gen{n}$$
Given a concrete ideal, how to find its generator $x$? Page 167 gives the answer. We summarize it here:

## 8.2 Principal ideal domains

>
> -   an **integral <u>domain</u>** (no zero divisors)

> So **every ideal $I \subseteq \Z$** is a **principal** ideal, i.e.
> $$\forall I \subseteq \Z : \exists n \in \Z : \boxed{I = \gen{n} = n\Z}$$

So any ideal in $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ is of the form $n\Z$ for some integer $n$.
If $a + n\Z$ is a coset of such ideal, we may assume that $a \in \Zn$, since because of Theorem 1.3.7, $a + n\Z = (a \bmod n) + n\Z$. If $a\in\Zn$, we say that $a$ is the **standard representative** of the coset $a + n\Z$ and that $a + n\Z$ is in **standard form**.

Now, we want to replicate this result for ideals in polynomial rings over a field $\F$.

> [!proposition] Proposition 8.2.3 (p167)
> Let $(\F, +, \cdot)$ be a field. Then the polynomial ring with coefficients in $\F$ is a PID:
> $$\boxed{(\F[X], +, \cdot) \text{ is a principal ideal domain (PID)}}$$

> [!definition] A divisor of polynomials in $(\F[X], +, \cdot)$

> [!definition] Greatest common divisor (gcd) of polynomials in $(\F[X], +, \cdot)$
> Let $f_1(X), f_2(X) \in \F[X]$ be two polynomials. We define <u>**a**</u> **greatest common divisor** (gcd) of $f_1(X)$ and $f_2(X)$ as a polynomial $d(X) \in \F[X]$ such that it has the **highest degree** among all common divisors of $f_1(X)$ and $f_2(X)$.

We wrote **a** common divisor because the gcd is **only unique up to multiplication by a non-zero constant** in $\F$. If $d(X)$ is a gcd of $f_1(X)$ and $f_2(X)$, then so is $a \cdot d(X)$ for any $a \in \F^* = \F \setminus \{0\}$. We can get around this by defining the gcd to be **monic** (leading coefficient equal to 1). This convention makes the **gcd unique**.

Proof: we have either

-   $\boxed{deg(g(X)) < \deg(f(X))}$: The coset is already in standard form; just choose $r(X) := g(X)$.
-   $\boxed{deg(g(X)) \geq \deg(f(X))}$: then perform **polynomial division** of $g(X)$ by $f(X)$ to get$$\boxed{g(X) = q(X) \cdot f(X) + r(X)}$$
    Because $q(X)\cdot f(X) \in \F[X]$, and because for any subgroup $H \subseteq G: f H = H \Leftrightarrow f \in H$:$$\begin{align}g(X) + I &= [q(X) \cdot f(X) + r(X)] + I \\&= [(q(X) \cdot f(X)) + \gen{f(X)}] + [r(X) + \gen{f(X)}]\\&=[0 + \gen{f(X)}]  + [r(X) + I] \\&= r(X) + I\end{align}$$

## 8.3 Quotient rings

In group theory, we considered **normal** subgroups in order to construct **quotient groups**. In ring theory, we will consider **ideals** in order to construct **quotient rings**.

> [!definition] Cosets of an ideal
> Since an ideal $I$ of the ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ is by definition a _subgroup_ of the _additive group_ $(R, +)$, we can define cosets of $I$ in $R$ by $r$ as:$$r+I = \{r + x \mid x \in I\}$$

Recall that any $r_1 \in r+I$ is called a **representative** of that coset.
Also recall that two cosets $fH$ and $gH$ are equal $\Leftrightarrow$ $f^{-1}g \in H$ (Theorem 4.3.4). In the case of ideals, this means that two cosets $r + I$ and $s + I$ are equal if...

> [!exam] Equality of cosets of an ideal
> Let $I$ be an ideal of the commutative ring $(R, +, \cdot)$. Then
> $$\boxed{r + I = s + I \iff s - r \in I} \qquad \text{(Theorem 4.3.4)}$$
> Because $I \subseteq R$ is a subgroup of the additive group $(R, +)$ and the additive inverse of any element $r \in R$ is $-r$.

Furthermore, since $(R, +)$ is an **abelian** group, the left coset $r + I$ is equal to the right coset $I + r$ for any $r \in R$. This implies that $I$ is a **normal subgroup of $R$** and therefore we can define the **quotient group** $(R/I, +)$ with addition defined by
$$\boxed{(r + I) + (s + I) := (r + s) + I}.$$

> [!lemma] Lemma 8.3.1 (p169)
> Let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal of the commutative ring $(R, +, \cdot)$. Then the following operation on cosets is well defined:
> $$\boxed{(r + I) \cdot (s + I) := (r \cdot s) + I}$$

Now we give the set $R/I$ of all cosets of the ideal $I$ in $R$ the structure of a ring by defining addition and multiplication of cosets:

We pronounce $R/I$ as "**$R$ modulo $I$**".

> [!exam]

Why is $I = i + I$ for any $i \in I$? Because $I$ is a subgroup of the additive (abelian) group $(R, +_R)$, so for any $i \in I$, we have that $$\boxed{I = i + I_R} \iff 0_R +_R I = i +_R I \iff 0_R \sim_{I} i \iff -0_R +_R i = \boxed{i \in I}$$

## 8.4 Extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomials

For polynomials $f(X), g(X) \in (\Z_p[X], +_p, \cdot_p) = (\F_p[X], +_p, \cdot_p)$ over a finite field $\F_p$ (with $p$ prime), we can compute their gcd using the **Extended Euclidean algorithm**: we find $r(X), s(X) \in \F_p[X]$ such that

> [!exam] Extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomials
> For $f(X), g(X) \in \F_p[X]$, we can compute their gcd $m(X) = \text{gcd}(f(X), g(X))$ together with polynomials $r(X), s(X) \in \F_p[X]$ such that
>
> $$
> \boxed{\text{gcd}(f(X), g(X)) \quad=\quad m(X) \quad=\quad r(X) \cdot f(X) + s(X) \cdot g(X)}
> $$
>
> Where $m(X)$ is **unique** if it is **monic**.

To do so, we construct a matrix with two rows $R_1$ and $R_2$ initialized as

$$
\left[\begin{array}{c|cc}
f(X) & 1 & 0\\
g(X) & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$

Where each row represents the equation
$$R_i: \quad \text{position 1} = (\text{position 2}) \cdot f(X) + (\text{position 3}) \cdot g(X)$$

We iteratively update this matrix with

$$
\begin{cases}
R_1 \leftarrow R_1 +_p v(X) \cdot R_2 & \quad \text{if }\deg(R_1) \geq \deg(R_2) \\
R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2 & \quad \text{if }\deg(R_2) > \deg(R_1)
\end{cases}
$$

where $v(X) \in \F_p[X]$ is the polynomial that makes the degree of $R_1$ strictly smaller after the update.

We stop when $R_1$ position 1 becomes **constant** (degree 0). Then, we have two possibilities:

-   If $R_1$ position 1 is equal to 0, we ignore $R_1$ and look at the identity in $R_2$.
-   If $R_1$ position 1 is equal to a non-zero constant $c \in \F_p^*$, we multiply the entire row $R_1$ by $c^{-1} \in \F_p^*$ to make the GCD **MONIC** (leading coefficient equal to 1).
