## 5.1 Group actions

> [!definition] Definition 5.1.1: Group action (p109)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $A$ a set. A **group action _of_ $G$ _on_ $A$** is a **map**$$

We say that "the **group $G$ _acts_ on the set $A$ via the group action $\varphi$**".

On occasion we would like to evaluate the permutation $\varphi(f) \in S_A$ in an element $a$ of $A$. This would give rise to a notation such as $\varphi(f)[a]$. To avoid having to use parentheses and brackets in this way, we will often **write $\varphi_f$ instead of $\varphi(f)$**.

In this notation, a **group action of $G$ on $A$ satisfies**

1. $\boxed{\varphi_e = \text{id}_A}$
2. $\forall f, g \in G: \boxed{\varphi_{f \cdot g} = \varphi_f \circ \varphi_g}$

> [!lemma] Lemma 5.1.2: Properties of group actions (p110)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. Then
> $$\forall f \in G : \boxed{\varphi_{f^{-1}} = (\varphi_f)^{-1}}$$
> So the permutation induced by the inverse of an element $f$ of $G$ is the inverse of the permutation induced by $f$.

Examples of group actions:

-   For the group $G = \operatorname{GL}(2, \R)$, the set $A = \R^2$ and the group action $\varphi : \operatorname{GL}(2, \R) \to S_{\R^2}$ defined by$$\forall M \in \operatorname{GL}(2, \R), \forall x \in \R^2 :\quad \varphi_M[x] := M x$$we have a group action of $\operatorname{GL}(2, \R)$ on $\R^2$.

-   The symmetric group on $n$ letters, denoted $S_n$, acts on the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ by defining $$\boxed{\varphi : S_n \to S_{\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}}: \quad \varphi_f \mapsto f}$$

> [!definition] Conjugate of an element in a group (p110)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $f, g \in G$. The element$$f \cdot g \cdot f^{-1} $$is called the **conjugate of $g$**.

-   A group $(G, \cdot)$ **acts on itself via conjugation** by defining the group action $\varphi : G \to S_G$ as$$\forall f, g \in G : \quad \varphi_f[g] := f \cdot g \cdot f^{-1}.$$So why is $fgf^{-1}$ a permutation of $G$? Because the map $\varphi_f : G \to G : g \mapsto fgf^{-1}$ has the inverse map $\varphi_{f^{-1}} : G \to G : g \mapsto f^{-1}gf$ and by Lemma 2.1.4 it is thus a bijection. Also, a bijection from the set to itself is a permutation, by definition of permutation (Section 2.2, p44)

> [!exercise] Exercise 5.12: A group acts on itself via **conjugation**.
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group. Then the map$$\varphi : G \to S_G : \quad \varphi_f[g] = f \cdot g \cdot f^{-1}$$is a **group action of $G$ on itself**.

> [!exercise] Exercise 5.11: Center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group. The **center** of $G$ is the set$$\boxed{Z(G) = \{ g \in G \mid \forall f \in G : g \cdot f = f \cdot g \}} = \{f \in G \mid \varphi_f = \text{id}_G\}$$
> For any $g \in Z(G)$, we have $O_g = \{g\}$ and $G_g = G$.

> [!exercise] Exercise 5.20: $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group. Then $Z(G)$ is a **normal subgroup** of $G$.
> In other words, the left and right cosets of $Z(G)$ in $G$ coincide:$$\forall g \in G : \boxed{g \cdot Z(G) = Z(G) \cdot g}$$

-   For any $f\in G, g \in Z(G)$, we can use the rule $fg = gf$.
-   $Z(G)$ is the union of all singleton orbits, i.e. $Z(G) = \bigcup_{g \in Z(G)} O_g = \{g\}$.
-   $f \cdot Z(G) = Z(G) \cdot f$ for all $f \in G$.
-   $g \in Z(G) \iff \{g\}$ is an orbit under the conjugation action of $G$ on itself.

## 5.2 Orbits and stabilizers

> [!definition] Definition 5.2.1: Orbit and stabilizer (p111)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. Then we define for each $a \in A$:
>
> -   The **orbit of $a$** under the action of $G$ is the _set_
>     $$
>       \boxed{O_{a} := \{ \varphi_g[a] \mid g \in G \}} \subseteq A
>     $$
> -   The **stabilizer of $a$** in $G$ is the **<u>subgroup</u>**
>     $$
>       \boxed{G_{a} := \{ g \in G \mid \varphi_g[a] = a \}} \subseteq G
>     $$

> [!exercise] Exercise 6 (II): Stabilizer is a subgroup
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. Further let $a \in A$. Then **all <u>stabilizers are subgroups</u>**:
> $$G_a = \{ g \in G \mid \varphi_g[a] = a \} \text{ is a } \textbf{subgroup} \text{ of } (G, \cdot).$$

Just like cosets are equivalence classes of a certain equivalence relation (recall that $\boxed{f \sim_H g \iff f^{-1}g \in H}$), **orbits are also equivalence classes** of a certain equivalence relation.

> [!lemma] Lemma 5.2.5: $\sim_\varphi$ is an equivalence relation with equivalence classes given by orbits (p112)
> Let $\varphi : G \to S_A$ be a group action of $G$ on $A$. Define the relation $\sim_\varphi$ on $A$ as$$\forall a, b \in A : \quad \boxed{a \sim_\varphi b \iff \exists f \in G : b = \varphi_f[a]}$$
> Then $\sim_\varphi$ is an **equivalence relation on $A$**. Moreover, for any $a \in A$, the equivalence class of $a$ with respect to $\sim_\varphi$ is
> $$\boxed{[a]_{\sim_\varphi} = O_{a}}$$

Now, just like for cosets, we apply Theorem 1.3.3 (properties of equivalence classes) to the orbits $O_a$:

> [!proposition] Proposition 5.2.6: Properties of orbits (p112)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. Then
>
> 1. $\forall a \in A : \boxed{a \in O_a}$
> 2. The set $A$ is covered by all orbits: $\boxed{\bigcup_{a \in A} O_{a} = A}$.
> 3. $\forall a, b \in A$, **either**
>     - $O_a = O_b$
>     - $O_a \cap O_b = \emptyset$
> 4. $\forall a, b \in A : \boxed{O_a = O_b \iff \exists f \in G : b = \varphi_f[a]} \, \iff a \sim_\varphi b$.

Proposition 5.2.6 says that **$A$ is the disjoint union of its <u>distinct</u> orbits**. This means that $|A|$ is the sum of the sizes of its distinct orbits:

> [!exam] Size of $A$ as sum of sizes of orbits
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$.

> $$\boxed{|A| = \sum_{i \in I} |O_{a_i}|}$$
> This follows from Proposition 5.2.6, which says that
> **$A$ is the disjoint union of its <u>distinct</u> orbits**.

Now we will study stabilizers.

> Lert $\varphi : G \to S_A$ be a group action of $(G,\cdot)$ on a set $A$. Further let $a \in A$. Then

> -   If $b \in O_a$ and $f \in G$ statisfies $b = \varphi_f[a]$, then$$f\cdot G_a = \{ g \in G \mid \varphi_g[a] = b \}.$$ "If you know one element $f$ that moves $a$ to $b$, then **all** other elements $g$ that also move $a$ to $b$, look like $f$ times something in the stabilizer $G_a$ of $a$"

<b style="color:red;">ORBIT-STABILIZER THEOREM</b>
_(Remember that $G_a$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ by Lemma 5.2.7 and we can thus consider the index $[G : G_a]$, i.e. the number of left cosets $f \cdot G_a$ of $G_a$ in $G$.)_

> [!theorem] Theorem 5.2.8: **Orbit-stabilizer theorem** (p114)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and suppose that $\varphi : G \to S_A$ is a group action of $G$ on a set $A$. Then for any $a \in A$, we have
>
> $$
> \boxed{[G : G_a] = |O_a|}
> $$
>
> In case $G$ is **<u>finite</u>**, we have
> $$|O_a| = [G : G_a] \overset{\text{Lagrange}}{=} \frac{|G|}{|G_a|} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \boxed{|G| = |G_a| \cdot |O_a|}$$

For any $a \in A$, the number of distinct left cosets of the stabilizer $G_a$ in $G$ is equal to the size of the orbit $O_a$. In case $G$ is **_finite_**, we can apply Lagrange's theorem to conclude that **the size of the orbit $O_a$ times the size of the stabilizer $G_a$ is equal to the size of the group $G$.**

The above **orbit-stabilizer theorem** is very useful to solve combinatorial problems.

> [!deduction] Size of an orbit divides size of the group
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a **finite group** that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. Then for any $a \in A$, the **size of the orbit $O_a$ divides the size of the group $G$**:
> $$\boxed{|O_a| \text{ divides } |G|}$$

<b style="color:red;">TODO: EXAMPLE COMBINATORIAL PROBLEM</b>

## 5.3 Burnside's lemma

Now we will use the theory of group actions to solve the following problem:

-   we take a **cube**
-   give **each of the six sides** (also called _faces_ or _facets_) of the cube a **color**
-   Let us assume that we can choose between **2 colors**.
-   Then a priori there are **$2^6$ possible colorings**
-   "Two colorings are the same if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation symmetry of the cube"
-   **How many distinct colorings** does the cube have?

> [!theorem] Definition 5.3.1: **Burnside's lemma** (p115)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a **finite group** that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. Define
> $$\boxed{\operatorname{Fix}(g) := \{ a \in A \mid \varphi_g[a] = a \}}$$for each $g \in G$. Then the **number of distinct orbits** of $A$ under the action of $G$ is equal to
> $$\boxed{\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |\operatorname{Fix}(g)|}$$

In case of the cube coloring problem, we have model the colorings as a set $A = \{\mathrm{coloring}_1, \mathrm{coloring}_2, \ldots \mathrm{coloring}_{2^6}\}$.

We consider the group action $$\varphi : G \to S_A$$of the group $G$ of rotational symmetries of the cube (not a regular $n$-gon, so no $C_n$ or $D_n$) on the set $A$ of colorings. An orbit $O_{a} \subseteq A$ of a coloring $a$ represents other elements (=_colorings_) in $A$ that can be reached from $a \in A$ by a permutation $\varphi_g$ of the six side colors for **some** rotation $g \in G$. To find the number of **distinct colorings**, we thus need to find the number of **distinct orbits** of $A$ under the action of $G$.

We apply **Burnside's lemma** to find the number of distinct orbits. For this, we need to find $|\operatorname{Fix}(g)|$ for each rotation $g \in G$.

Let's compute the number of rotational symmetries of the cube:

-   A cube has $8$ vertices, $12$ edges, and $6$ faces.
-   **Identity rotation:**
    -   $1$ such rotation
    -   $1\Rightarrow 1$ rotation.
    -   $|\operatorname{Fix}(e)| = 2^6 = 64$ colorings.
-   **Axis 1: through the centers of opposite faces**
    -   There are $3$ such axes, each allowing for $3$ rotations (**excluding** identity $e$!)
        -   a $90^\circ$ rotation
        -   a $180^\circ$ rotation
        -   a $270^\circ$ rotation
        -   a $360^\circ$ rotation (= identity, already counted) (II)
    -   $3\Rightarrow 3 \cdot 3 = 9$ rotations.
-   **Axis 2: through the midpoints of opposite edges.**
    -   There are $6$ such axes, each allowing for $1$ rotation (**excluding** identity $e$!):
        -   a $180^\circ$ rotation
        -   a $360^\circ$ rotation (= identity, already counted)
    -   $6\Rightarrow 6 \cdot 1 = 6$ rotations.
-   **Axis 3: through opposite vertices/corners.**
    -   There are $4$ such axes, each allowing for $2$ rotations (**excluding** identity $e$!)
        -   a $120^\circ$ rotation
        -   a $240^\circ$ rotation
        -   a $360^\circ$ rotation (= identity, already counted)
    -   $4\Rightarrow 4 \cdot 2 = 8$ rotations.
-   In total, there are $1 + 9 + 6 + 8 = 24$ rotational symmetries of the cube, so $|G| = 24$.

For all 24 rotations $g \in G$, we need to compute $|\operatorname{Fix}(g)|$, i.e. the number of colorings that remain unchanged under the rotation $g$.

-   **Identity rotation**: $|\operatorname{Fix}(e)| = 2^6 = 64$ colorings.
-   **Axis 1, angle $pi/2$ or $3pi/2$**: (3 axes, 2 angles each = 6 rotations)
    -   Top and bottom faces remain fixed ($2^2$ choices).
    -   The 4 side faces cycle among themselves, so they must all be the same color (2 choices).
    -   TOTAL: $6 \times 2^3$ colorings remaining fixed.
-   **Axis 1, angle $pi$**: (3 axes, 1 angle each = 3 rotations)
    -   Top and bottom faces remain fixed ($2^2$ choices).
    -   The 4 side faces form 2 pairs that swap, so each pair must be the same color (2 choices for each of the two pairs).
    -   TOTAL: $3 \times 2^2 \times 2^2 = 3 \times 2^4$ colorings remaining fixed.
-   **Axis 2, angle $pi$**: (6 axes, 1 angle each = 6 rotations)
    -   The 6 faces form 3 pairs that swap, so each pair must be the same color (2 choices for each of the three pairs).
    -   TOTAL: $6 \times 2^3$ colorings remaining fixed.
-   **Axis 3, angle $2pi/3$ or $4pi/3$**: (4 axes, 2 angles each = 8 rotations)
    -   Each rotation groups the 6 faces into 2 cycles of 3 faces each, so each cycle must be the same color (2 choices for each of the two cycles).
    -   TOTAL: $8 \times 2^2$ colorings remaining fixed.

Now we can apply Burnside's lemma to find the number of distinct colorings:
$$\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |\operatorname{Fix}(g)| = \frac{1}{24} (64 + 48 + 48 + 48 + 32) = \frac{240}{24} = 10.$$

### Exercises

> [!exercise] Exercise 5.12: Transitive group actions
>
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a finite group that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. The action is called **transitive** if
> $$\boxed{\forall a, b \in A : \exists f \in G : \varphi_f[a] = b}$$
> Or, in other words, if there is **only one orbit**, i.e. $\boxed{O_a = A}$ for any $a \in A$.

Why is there only one orbit? Because by definition of transitive action, for any $a, b \in A$, there exists $f \in G$ such that $b = \varphi_f[a]$. By Lemma 5.2.5, this means that $a \sim_\varphi b$, so $O_a = O_b$. Since this is true for any $a, b \in A$, all orbits are equal, and thus there is only one orbit, which must be the entire set $A$, since orbits cover $A$ (Proposition 5.2.6, point 2).

> [!exercise] Exercise 5.19: Double transitive group actions
>
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a finite group that acts on a set $A$ via the group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$. The action is called **doubly transitive** if
> $$\boxed{\forall a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \in A, a_1 \neq a_2, b_1 \neq b_2 : \exists f \in G : \varphi_f[a_1] = b_1 \text{ and } \varphi_f[a_2] = b_2}$$
> We can define the group action $\psi : G \to S_{A \times A}$ on $A \times A$ as$$\forall f \in G, \forall (a_1, a_2) \in A \times A : \quad \psi_f[(a_1, a_2)] = (\varphi_f[a_1], \varphi_f[a_2])$$And we see that being doubly transitive is equivalent to saying that the group action $\psi$ is transitive on the set$$\{ (a_1, a_2) \in A \times A \mid a_1 \neq a_2 \} = A^2 \setminus \{(a,a) \mid a \in A\}.$$
> This in turn means that there is **only one orbit** $$\boxed{O_{(a_1, a_2)} = A^2 \setminus \{(a,a) \mid a \in A\}}$$ for the action $\psi$ on the set of distinct pairs.

**Why is $\psi$ on $A \times A$ transitive?**

Because for any two pairs $(a_1, a_2)$ and $(b_1, b_2)$ in $A \times A$ with $a_1 \neq a_2$ and $b_1 \neq b_2$, by the definition of doubly transitive action, there exists $f \in G$ such that $\varphi_f[a_1] = b_1$ and $\varphi_f[a_2] = b_2$. Therefore, $\psi_f[(a_1, a_2)] = (b_1, b_2)$, showing that any pair can be mapped to any other pair, which is the definition of transitivity for the action $\psi$ on the set of distinct pairs.

**Why only one orbit?**

Because for any two distinct pairs $(a_1, a_2)$ and $(b_1, b_2)$ in $A \times A$, there exists $f \in G$ such that $\psi_f[(a_1, a_2)] = (b_1, b_2)$. This means that the action $\psi$ can map any distinct pair to any other distinct pair, so all distinct pairs are in the same orbit under the action $\psi$.

We can see this in another way, too. By Proposition 5.2.6, point 4, two elements are in the same orbit if and only if they are related by the equivalence relation $\sim_\psi$. Since for any two distinct pairs $(a_1, a_2)$ and $(b_1, b_2)$, there exists $f \in G$ such that $\psi_f[(a_1, a_2)] = (b_1, b_2)$, it follows that $(a_1, a_2) \sim_\psi (b_1, b_2)$. Thus, all distinct pairs are equivalent under $\sim_\psi$, meaning they all belong to the same equivalence class, which is the orbit $O_{(a_1, a_2)}$. Therefore, there is only one orbit for the action $\psi$ on the set of distinct pairs.
