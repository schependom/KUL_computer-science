## 9.1 Quotients of polynomial rings with coefficients in a finite field

Using the Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we can reformulate Proposition 7.1.15, which said that a **non-zero** element $a \in \Zn$ is a unit $\Leftrightarrow \gcd(a,n) = 1$, and is a zero divisor $\Leftrightarrow \gcd(a,n) > 1$:

> [!proposition] Proposition 9.1.1: units and zero divisors in $\Zn$ (p183)
> Let $n \in \Z_{>0}, a \in \Z$. Then **exactly one** of the following three cases holds:
>
> 1. $a + n\Z$ is the **zero element** in $\Z/n\Z$, equivalently: $\gcd(a,n) = n$,
> 2. $a + n\Z$ is a **zero-divisor** in $\Z/n\Z$, equivalently: $1 < \gcd(a,n) < n$,
> 3. $a + n\Z$ is a **unit** in $\Z/n\Z$, equivalently: $\gcd(a,n) = 1$.

A similar proposition holds for quotient rings of polynomial rings with coefficients in a field:

> [!proposition] Proposition 9.1.2: units and zero divisors in $\F[X]/(p(x))$ (p184)
> Let $(\F, +, \cdot)$ be a field, and suppose that $f(X) \in \F[X]$ is a non-constant polynomial of degree $\boxed{d \geq 1}$. Further let $g(X) \in \F[X]$ be an arbitrary polynomial. Then **exactly one** of the following three cases holds:

because $$g(X) \cdot p_1(X) = m(X) \cdot p_2(X) \cdot p_1(X) = f(X) \cdot p_2(X) \in \gen{f(X)}.$$
and for an ideal $I$, we have that $$\boxed{i \in I \implies i + I = 0 + I = I}$$

Why is that? Because

$$
\begin{align*}
u(X) \cdot v(X) &= \big(g(X) + \gen{f(X)}\big) \cdot \big(p_1(X) + \gen{f(X)}\big)\\
&= g(X) \cdot p_1(X) + \gen{f(X)}\\
&= m(X) \cdot p_2(X) \cdot p_1(X) + \gen{f(X)}\\
&= f(X) \cdot p_2(X) + \gen{f(X)}\\
&= 0 + \gen{f(X)}
\end{align*}
$$

> [!exam] Proper monic factor is a zero divisor
> If $f(X) \in \F[X]$ has a **proper monic factor** $h(X) \in \F[X]$, then the coset $$\boxed{h(X) + \gen{f(X)}}$$**is a zero divisor** in $\F[X]/\gen{f(X)}$.

In this case, $\gcd(f(X), h(X)) = h(X)$, and since $h(X)$ is a proper factor, we have that $0 < \deg(h(X)) < \deg(f(X)) \implies 0 < \deg(\gcd(f(X), h(X))) < \deg(f(X))$, so by Proposition 9.1.2, $h(X) + \gen{f(X)}$ is a zero divisor in $\F[X]/\gen{f(X)}$.

Furthermore, **any multiple** of this proper monic factor with degree less than $\deg(f(X))$ is also a zero divisor:

> [!Exam] Multiple of proper monic factor is a zero divisor
> For a proper monic factor $h(X) \in \F[X]$ of $f(X) \in \F[X]$

> $$

Why is this the case? Because $\gcd(f(X), h(X) \cdot a(X))$ has degree at least $\deg(h(X))$ (since $h(X)$ divides both $f(X)$ and $h(X) \cdot a(X)$), and since $\deg(h(X)) < \deg(f(X))$, we have that $$0 < \deg(\gcd(f(X), h(X) \cdot a(X))) < \deg(f(X)),$$so by Proposition 9.1.2, $h(X) \cdot a(X) + \gen{f(X)}$ is a zero divisor in $\F[X]/\gen{f(X)}$.

## 9.2 Construction of fields using irreducible polynomials

We saw already a field $(\Z_p, +_p, \cdot_p) = (\F_p, +, \cdot)$ can be constructed as the quotient ring $\Z/p\Z$ where $p$ is a prime number.

Another procedure to produce fields is by considering **quotient rings** of $\F[X]$, the polynomial ring with coefficients in a field $\F$. We will need the **analogue of prime numbers for polynomials**, which are called **irreducible polynomials**.

> [!definition] Definition 9.2.1: irreducible polynomial (p186)
> Let $(\F, +, \cdot)$ be a field. A polynomial $f(X) \in \F[X]$ is called **irreducible** if

_BECAUSE RECALL_: In a **domain**, $\forall p(X), q(X) \in R[X]: \deg(p(X) \cdot q(X)) = \deg(p(X)) + \deg(q(X))$.
So, in fields (which are $\subseteq$ domains):$$\boxed{\deg(g(X)\cdot h(X)) = \deg(g(X)) + \deg(h(X))}$$

It is easy to check whether a polynomial of degree at most 3 is irreducible.

> [!lemma] Lemma 9.2.4: Irreducibility of 1-degree polynomials (p186)
> Let $(\F, +, \cdot)$ be a field. **Any polynomial $f(X) \in \F[X]$ of degree 1 is irreducible**.

> [!theorem] Theorem 9.2.10: Unique factorization into irreducible polynomials
> Let $(F,+, \cdot)$ be a field. Every polynomial $f(X) \in \F[X]$ of degree at least 1 can be written uniquely as a product of irreducible polynomials, that is, if $p_1(X) \cdot \ldots \cdot p_r(X) = q_1(X) \cdot \ldots \cdot q_s(X)$ where the $p_i(X)$s and the $q_i(X)$'s are irreducible polynomials, then $r = s$ and after relabeling the factors we have $p_i(X) = c_i q_i(X)$ for all i, where the $c_i \in \F$ are nonzero.

In other words, the factorization is **unique up to <u>multiplication by non-zero constants</u>** and rearranging the factors.

> [!theorem] Thereom 9.2.12: Construction of fields (p190)

> Then the quotient ring $$\boxed{(\F[X]/\gen{f(X)}, \cdot, +) \text{ is a \textbf{field}} \iff f(X) \text{ is \textbf{irreducible}}}$$

We can see $\F$ is a subset of $\E := \F[X]/\gen{f(X)}$ by identifying each element $a \in \F$ with the coset $a + \gen{f(X)} \in \E$.

$$
\boxed{\psi : \begin{cases}\F \to \E\\ a \mapsto a + \gen{f(X)}\end{cases} \quad \text{ is an injective ring homomorphism}}
$$

To avoid confusing elements from $\E$ with polynomials with coefficients in $\F$, we use the variable $T$ when talking about polynomials with coefficients in $\E$.
This means that we identify the polynomial$$a_0 + a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + \ldots + a_n X^n \in \F[X]$$with the element$$(a_0 + \gen{f(X)}) + (a_1 + \gen{f(X)}) T + (a_2 + \gen{f(X)}) T^2 + \ldots + (a_n + \gen{f(X)}) T^n \in \E[T]$$The above Lemma states that$$f(T) = \sum_{i=0}^{d} (a_i + \gen{f(X)}) T^i \in \E[T]$$has a root at $T = X + \gen{f(X)}$.

The polynomial $$f(T) = \sum_{i=0}^{d} a_i X^i \in \F[X]$$is identified with the polynomial $$f(T) = \sum_{i=0}^{d} (a_i + \gen{f(X)}) T^i \in \E[T]$$

## 9.3 Construction of finite fields

We will use the notation $\F_q$ for a field with $q$ elements (another common notation is $\mathrm{GF}(q)$, _Galois Field_ of order $q$).

> [!exam] Finite fields have order a prime power
>
> $$
> \begin{align*} d &= \deg(f(X)) \geq 1 \\
> p &= \text{prime number} \\
> q &= p^d \end{align*}
> $$

> [!lemma] Lemma 9.3.1 (p191): number of elements in quotient ring
> Let $f(X) \in \F_p[X]$ be a non-zero polynomial of degree $d \geq 1$. Then the quotient ring
>
> $$
> \boxed{(\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}, +, \cdot) \text{ is a finite \textbf{\red{ring}} with } p^d \text{ elements}}
> $$

We count the number of elements by considering the standard forms $r(X) + \gen{f(X)}$ of the cosets in $\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}$.
For these standard forms, $\deg(r(X)) < d$ or $deg(r(X)) = 0$.

Because the coefficients uniquely determine the polynomial, determining the number of $r(X)$ we can construct is equivalent to choosing the $a_i \in \F_p$ for $d$ coefficients, and thus there are $p^d$ such polynomials.

> [!theorem] Theorem 9.3.2 (p192)
> Let $f(X) \in \F_p[X]$ be an $\textbf{\red{irreducible}}$ polynomial of degree $d$. Then the quotient ring
>
> $$
> \boxed{(\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}, +, \cdot) \text{ is a finite \textbf{\red{field}} with } p^d \text{ elements}}
> $$
>
> We denote this field by
> $$\F_{\red{p^d}} = \boxed{\F_{\red{q}} := \big(\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}, +, \cdot\big)}$$
> Number of elements:
>
> $$
> \boxed{|F_{q}| = q = p^d = |F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}|}
> $$

> [!fact]
>
> $$\F_q = \big(\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}, +, \cdot\big) \text{ is a \textbf{field}} \iff f(X) \text{ is irreducible}$$

This follows from the fact that by the previous lemma, $|\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}| = p^d$, and by Theorem 9.2.12, $\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}$ is a field since $f(X)$ is irreducible.

We will see later that for any prime $p$ and $d \geq 1$, there exists **at least one** irreducible polynomial of degree $d$ in $\F_p[X]$, so finite fields with $p^d$ elements exist for all prime powers.

---

## 9.4 Primitive elements in finite fields

We have already seen that the units of a ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ form a group $(R^*, \cdot)$.
In the case of a finite field $(\F_q, +, \cdot)$ where $q = p^d$ for some prime $p$ and $d \geq 1$, we can say more about the structure of the group of units $(\F_q^*, \cdot)$.

> [!definition] Definition: primitive elment
> Let $q = p^d$ for some prime $p$ and $d \geq 1$. An element $\alpha \in \F_q$ is called a **primitive element** if BOTH
>
> 1. $\boxed{\alpha \neq 0}$ ($\Leftrightarrow \alpha \in \F_q^*$ is a unit)
> 2. its **multiplicative order** is $\boxed{\ord(\alpha) = q-1}$ as an element of the group $(\F_q^*, \cdot)$.

Recall that the order is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\alpha^n = 1_{\F_q^*}$.

It turns out that the **finite field $\F_q$ ($q = p^d$) always has a primitive element **$\alpha$.
In particular, $(\F_q^*, \cdot)$ is a cyclic group generated by $\alpha$.

> [!theorem] Theorem 9.4.1: multiplicative group of finite field is cyclic (p193)
> Let $(\F_q, +, \cdot)$ be a finite field with $q$ elements for some prime power $q = p^d$ ($d \geq 1$). Then the multiplicative group of units
>
> $$
> \boxed{(\F_q^*, \cdot) \text{ is a \textbf{cyclic} group}} \qquad \boxed{\F_q^* = \{\alpha^0, \alpha^1, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^{q-2}\}}
> $$
>
> Because in a field $\F^* = \F \setminus \{0\}$, we have that the **order** of this cyclic group is $$\boxed{|\F_q^*| = q-1 = \ord(\alpha)}$$

To prove this, we need to find a generator $\alpha \in \F_q^*$ such that any element $h \in \F_q^*$ can be written as $h = \alpha^k$ for some integer $k \geq 0$, which is the **primitive element** of $\F_q$.

Because in a field $\F^* = \F \setminus \{0\}$, we have that $$\F = \F^* \cup \{0\} \implies \boxed{\F = \{0, \alpha^0, \alpha^1, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^{q-2}\}}$$

By Lemma 3.2.3, we know that a **group of order $n$ is cyclic if and only if it contains an element of order $n$**. So we need to find an element $\alpha$ of order $q-1$ in $\F_q^*$.

We apply **Lagrange's Theorem** to the group $(\F_q^*, \cdot)$, which says that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. Proposition 4.4.4 says that this also holds for $|\gen{g}| = \operatorname{ord}(g)$, and thus we have that for any $g \in \F_q^*$ $$\boxed{\operatorname{ord}(g) \mid (q-1)}$$

Now we can apply Corollory 3.2.6 to this cyclic group of order $q-1$:

> [!corollary] Corollary 9.4.2
> Let $(\F_q, +, \cdot)$ be a finite field with $q$ elements for some prime power $q = p^d$ ($d \geq 1$).
> Further **let $m$ be a divisor of $q-1$**. Then
>
> $$
> \boxed{\text{there exist exactly } \varphi(m) = |\Z_m^*| \text{ elements in } (\F_q^*, \cdot) \text{ with multiplicative order } m}
> $$

> [!notation] Primitive element (p193)
> An element $c \in \F_q^*$ with multiplicative order $q-1$ is called a **primitive element** of the finite field $\F_q$. There exist $$\boxed{\text{exactly } \varphi(q-1) \text{ primitive elements in } \F_q}$$

So, given a primitive element $c \in \F_q^*$, we can find an $n \in \Z$ such that any element $h \in \F_q^*$ can be written as $h = c^n$, because $c$ is a generator of the cyclic group $\F_q^*$.

> [!exam] Finding a primitive element in $\F_q$
> To find a primitive element in $\F_q = \big(\F_p[X]/\gen{f(X)}, +, \cdot\big)$ where $f(X) \in \F_p[X]$ is irreducible of degree $d$ ($q = p^d$), we can use the following procedure:
>
> 1. Because of Theorem 9.4.1, we know that $(\F_q^*, \cdot)$ is cyclic of order $|\F_q^*| = q-1$.
> 2. Because of Lagranges Theorem (more specifically Proposition 4.4.4), we know that for any $g \in \F_q^*$ $$\boxed{\operatorname{ord}(g) \text{ divides } (q-1)}$$
> 3. The possible orders of elements in $\F_q^*$ are the divisors of $q-1$: $$\boxed{D = \{d \in \Z_{>0} \mid d \text{ divides } (q-1)\}}$$
> 4. A primitive element is an element $\alpha \in \F_q^*$ with order $\operatorname{ord}(\alpha) = q-1$.
> 5. We find that primitive element $\alpha$ by checking that $$\ord(\alpha) = q-1 \iff \boxed{\ord(\alpha) \notin D \setminus \{q-1\}}$$In other words, we find an element $\alpha$ such that its order is not any of the other divisors of $q-1$.

> [!exam] Factorization of a polynomial over a field
> If $f(X) \in \F[X]$ is a polynomial over a field $\F$ with $\deg(f(X)) = d \geq 1$, then we have the following trick to decide if its irreducible or not:

> 2. No root $\implies$ cannot be written as a product of degree 1 and degree $d-1$ polynomials
> 3. Check if it can be factored as a product of two polynomials of degrees $a$ and $b$ where $a,b \geq 2$ and $a+b=d$
>     - These two polynomials cannot have roots (else $f(X)$ would have a root)
>     - If $a, b \in \{2,3\}$, the polynomials must be irreducible (else they would have a root)
> 4. If it cannot be factored in such a way, then it is irreducible.

> [!exam]
> To find an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 in $\F_2[X]$, it is sufficient to find a polynomial of degree five that has no factors of degree 1 or 2.

Why?

-   If $f(X)$ is reducible into factors $f(X) = g(X) \cdot h(X)$, then $(\deg(g(X)), \deg(h(X))) = (1,4)$ or $(2,3)$.
-   If $f(X)$ has 3 factors, then $(\deg(g(X)), \deg(h(X)), \deg(k(X))) = (1,1,3)$ or $(1,2,2)$.
-   If $f(X)$ has 4 factors, then $(\deg(g(X)), \deg(h(X)), \deg(k(X)), \deg(l(X))) = (1,1,1,2)$.
-   If $f(X)$ has 5 factors, then $(\deg(g(X)), \deg(h(X)), \deg(k(X)), \deg(l(X)), \deg(m(X))) = (1,1,1,1,1)$.

Finding factors of degree one is equivalent to finding roots.

The only irreducible factors of degree 1 are $X$ and $X + 1$, while a direct
computation shows that the only irreducible polynomial in $\F_2[X]$ of
degree two equals $X^2 + X + 1$.
